      <p>I am an experienced transport planner, public policy maker and former city councillor who also does a lot of other things.</p>
      <p>Some of these include running a YouTube channel on Victoria's local history and transport, volunteering in tourism services and a historical society, making maps and writing.</p>
      <p>This website is designed as an introduction, a blog and central place to see what I get up to.</p>
      <p>Working across many different fields has sparked a lot of other interests and projects which I have documented here for you to explore.</p>
      <p>I am a strong believer in <b>free and open source</b>. The free internet is a precious thing that brings people and ideas together in a way that proprietary and closed source platforms and software can never do. As a non-developer this is bit harder to get into but is absolutely vital.</p>
