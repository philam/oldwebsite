During the initial lockdowns of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Victoria, the popularity of cycling skyrocketed. This was mainly related to people finding out about trails, routes and parks nearby for recreation as the restrictions on time, distance or both came into place.

There was also a big element of commuting and cycling for transport. People wanted to avoid public transport due to fears of being infected. While some chose to drove, others chose to ride.

This resulted in many people who had never ridden or not ridden for a long time being out and out.

Unfortunately this resulted in some people getting lost and others using dangerous routes by mistake.

For example, some had tried to use Google Maps to plan their journey. Unfortunately, as regular riders know, its facilities for bicycle wayfinding are substandard at best and downright dangerous at worst. For example, telling cyclists to ride along the Eastern Freeway to get from North Balwyn to Kew. This is not only highly dangerous but also illegal.

I wanted to help out during this time however I could. So I <a href="https://philipmallis.com/2020/03/23/offer-of-help-journey-planning-for-your-bicycle-route/">published an offer of help</a> for people wanting to plan their journeys by bike.

I set up a form for people to fill in with some details. I received about 70 requests within a couple of weeks - and I still get one occasionally to this day.
