The aim of this project was to create a unified design language for all of Australiaâ€™s heavy and light rail networks.

I published a single map for each Australian city with an urban heavy or light rail network. To make the maps more readily recognisable, I used the same colour palette as official sources.

Although I did later encounter some <a href="https://maps.philipmallis.com/a-trademark-claim/">trademark issues</a>, I was able to resolve this quickly.
