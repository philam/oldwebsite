<a href="https://boroondarawiki.org">BoroondaraWiki</a> is a free and open source online encyclopaedia established to document the history and information on locations within the City of Boroondara in Melbourne, Australia.

I started the website in 2017. Since then, I have created 645 pages on a wide range of mainly historical topics. These include:

* All members of the <a href="https://boroondarawiki.org/wiki/Members_of_the_Boroondara_District_Road_Board">Boroondara District Road Board</a>, <a href="https://boroondarawiki.org/wiki/Councillors_of_Camberwell_Council">Camberwell Town Council</a> and other precedessor local governmenst to the present-day Boroondara City Council
* Writing a short history of the Boroondara District Road Board
* Documenting <a href="https://boroondarawiki.org/wiki/Category:Pages_using_election_box_templates">local electoral results</a>

This work has also included technical tasks, including maintaining a MediaWiki installation with several extensions and dependencies.
