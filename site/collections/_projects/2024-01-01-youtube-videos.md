I started a <a href="https://youtube.com/philipmallis">YouTube channel</a> in December 2017 and started making videos in 2022. This has since grown to an audience of over 17,000 subscribers and 1.8 million views.

The main aim is to share topics on Melbourne's local history and transport that are lesser-known. I typically make videos on topics that are not well documented or known.

History gives us context on where we have come from and where we are going. This is why I believe it is very important to document and share events and stories from the past.

Some examples include:
* Freeways that were planned but never built from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLath5Vf0H2tGiRwrunniC_kv6nZpYD9xC">1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan</a>
* How the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLath5Vf0H2tHqySPxnCllWyI6LgrnbWUj">Second World War influenced Melbourne</a>
* History of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbGIPoXh9vs">Melbourne's drinking fountains</a>
