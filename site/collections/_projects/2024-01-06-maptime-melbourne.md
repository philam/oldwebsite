In 2018, several people in Melbourne all had the same idea at the same time. This was to set up an informal group of people who would meet to work on open source mapping - in particular <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>.

We then met and worked together to set up a chapter of the global Maptime movement in Melbourne.

I was involved in organising and running several 'mapathon' and similar events. These usually involved a particular task for the day and training people who had not mapped before.

The group grew where we partnered with other organisations. This included participating in the 2018 Malaria Congress with the Burnett Institute, Georabble and kicking off the first <<a href="https://2018.foss4g-oceania.org">>FoSS4G State of the Map Oceania Conference in Melbourne</a> in 2018.
