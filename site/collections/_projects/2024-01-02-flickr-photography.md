I take a lot of photos. These are mostly released for anyone to use for free under the terms of the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License</a> over on my <a href="https://flickr.com/philipmallis">Flickr account</a>.

They are mainly photos around cities, nature and urban transport, mostly taken with my camera phone and Canon 90D DSLR camera.


See my Flickr collection with over 25,000 photos and videos available to view and a sample of these below.
