I have extensive experience presenting and teaching in a wide variety of settings. From my professional experience as a sessional tutor with the <a href="https://unimelb.edu.au">University of Melbourne</a> teaching urban planning, through to volunteering to run <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> training sessions with Maptime Melbourne.
