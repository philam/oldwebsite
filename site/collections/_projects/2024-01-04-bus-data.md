Accurate, comprehensive and transparent data is essential. There is a lot of public transport information that is collected in Victoria but not all of it is published.

In this case, bus patronage data was not publicly available for many years. Seeing this gap, I requested the information from the Department of Transport who were able to provide it.

This allowed me to <a href="https://philipmallis.com/2019/04/05/melbourne-bus-patronage-data-2008-2017/">publish the information</a> and release it for anyone to use. I also made my own maps and posts with analysis and commentary. This included a <a href="https://maps.philipmallis.com/victorian-bus-stop-patronage/">map of bus stop patronage</a> for all metropolitan and town buses in Victoria which has been used over 11,000 times to date.

I have done similar projects on transport data as well. These include <a href="https://philam.github.io/trainstationcarparks/">mapping railway station carparks</a>, <a href="https://philipmallis.com/2021/07/19/the-most-and-least-punctual-bus-routes-in-melbourne/">analysing the punctuality of bus routes in Melbourne</a> and <a href="https://philipmallis.com/2019/02/14/station-patronage-in-victoria-2013-2018/">publishing railway station patronage data for Victoria</a> from Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.
