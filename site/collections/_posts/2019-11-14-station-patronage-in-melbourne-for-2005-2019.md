While accountants may be excited by the end of a financial year, gunzels get excited for another reason – new station patronage data!

Using the [same method as last year](https://philipmallis.com/blog/2019/02/14/station-patronage-in-victoria-2013-2018/), I have asked for and obtained the latest 2018-19 patronage data from the Department of Transport. I’m still waiting for V/Line station data, although I suspect that I may have to do another FOI request for this information.

DoT very kindly sent me a spreadsheet which included patronage data right back to 2005, so this supersedes the spreadsheet that I published last year in terms of comprehensiveness. I have made a few small alterations, including an extra column showing the percentage change.

You can download the spreadsheet [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xEcNOel8EBciHQX8H4F5aWiKdc-DpF3V/view?usp=sharing).

I may look at a better way of storing and sharing this data given that it can be updated periodically and not just as a ‘one off’. I’ll do another post on that should it come up.

### Some brief observations

I’ll do some more detailed posts soon on the data. For now, here are some notes from a quick glance.

Overall, patronage has continued to increase – from 229.4 million trips in 2017-18 to 231.6 million trips in 2018-19.

This data also includes all Mernda Extension stations and, for the first time, stations on the Flemington Racecourse Line.

There are some interesting rises and falls by station:

- **Southern Cross** has continued its long-term trend of increasing patronage (5.0% – or around 938,000 extra trips annually). For comparison, **Flinders Street’s** patronage increased by 0.6% (or about 160,000 trips annually).
- **Melbourne Central** has seen a notable decline in the number of passengers (-3.83% or 608,000 trips annually). My guess is that this might be due to the large number of disruptions resulting in trains being directed out of the City Loop in 2018-19. This might have resulted in more passengers using Southern Cross instead.
- **South Morang** has seen a decrease of 30.0% (or around 380,000 trips annually). This is probably due to the Mernda Extension opening and associated construction impacts. People who previously had to travel to South Morang to catch a train can now access one of the three new stations that would be closer to their home.
- **Rosanna, Hughesdale and Southland** all had the three highest increases in patronage. However, the first two were disrupted for long periods due to level crossing removal projects, and Southland opened part way through 2017-18, so these are not typical comparisons.
- The biggest surprise to me is that **Crib Point** comes out as having the highest percentage increase of passengers of 43.3% (excluding the three stations mentioned above). Admittedly, these are low numbers – an increase from 12,496 in 2017-18 to 17,911 in 2018-19. Not sure why this might be the case.
- **Officer** continues its trend of huge increases in patronage, which increased by 31.7% in 2018-19. This is almost certainly due to the large-scale urban sprawl in the area. For the first time, it has cracked 100,000 annual trips. Just four years ago in 2015-16, Officer’s annual patronage was 60,256. In 2018-19, it has more than doubled to 122,892.
- **Carrum** has seen the greatest decrease in patronage of 31.7%. No surprises here, given that it was disrupted for long periods in early 2019 due to level crossing removal works. As of 9 July 2019 (outside of these statistics), it has been closed until 2020 to allow the station and its precinct to be rebuilt.
- **Westona** has the most stable patronage as a percentage between 2017-18 and 2018-19 – a difference of only -0.01%. **Morradoo** has the most stable patronage as an absolute number (only 2 fewer people in 2018-19 compared to 2017-18).
