Yesterday I spoke at Beckett Park at the first concert in the Summer Music series of musical events hosted by the City of Boroondara. It was a great event and many hundreds of people turned out in the heat to enjoy the music. Itâ€™s fantastic to see arts and culture combined with our beautiful parks and gardens to produce events like this.

There are two more events in the series, one in Markham Reserve, Ashburton this coming Saturday, and jazz at Canterbury Gardens on the 22nd February. All events are free! You can find more information here: <http://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/our-city/arts-culture/summer-music>
