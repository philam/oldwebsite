The post for this fortnight is a little different – in the form of a video instead.

A few weeks ago, I walked the length of the Yan Yean Pipeline from Yan Yean Reservoir to the storage reservoirs at Preston.

You can see the video below or at [this link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxrBvthAJfA).

But it was a really fun walk to do and I hope to walk more pipelines and aqueducts in the near future.
