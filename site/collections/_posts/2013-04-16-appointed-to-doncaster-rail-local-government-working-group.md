At last nightâ€™s Services Special Committee meeting, I was one of three councillors [appointed](http://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Minutes_5170dc8a0fea8.pdf "appointed") to represent the City of Boroondara on the Doncaster Rail Local Government Working Group. Councillors Hurd and Healey were the other two councillors appointed. These appointments will allow councillors to be more involved in the great work already done by the Group.
