Want to have an impact on Councilâ€™s decision-making? Do you want to send your thoughts and comments to be considered?

The Boroondara Community Voice Panel is an online group of people who live, work or play in Boroondara, give feedback to Council and get involved in the process of decision-making at Council.

There are already many hundreds of members, and we want to hear from you. The feedback received does make a difference (click [here](http://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/your_council/your-say/community-panel/past-bcv-topics) to see reports from previous topics) and has impacts on decision-making.

Topics covered so far include the Hawthorn Arts Centre branding, Urban Biodiversity Strategy and booked hard waste collection trial. The most recent topic that is currently being discussed is road safety.
