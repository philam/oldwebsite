Last week marked the halfway point of my council term. Around this time two years ago, I was [elected](http://philipmallis.com/2012/10/28/provisional-results-look-good-further-election-coverage/) to represent Maranoa Ward in Boroondara. Since then, Council has had many significant achievements. For my ward specifically, there has been tens of millions of dollars worth of investment into the local community over the past two years, in an area which has traditionally suffered from a lack of services. These achievements include:

\[list type=arrow\_list\]

- Established the Youth Reference Group
- Lowest rate rises in a decade without compromising services
- Successfully lobbied the state government for bus service improvements on the route 285
- Boroondara Sports Complex redevelopment
- Balwyn Park Masterplan adoption
- Pedestrian improvements in the Balwyn Shopping Centre
- Commencement of the North-East Community Hub project
- Greythorn Tennis Club pavilion redevelopment
- North Balwyn Tennis Club pavilion redevelopment
- Yerrin St pedestrianisation (money allocated for 2016-17)
- New residential zones
- Maranoa Gardens Conservation Plan
- Walk, Rest, Talk program

\[/list\]

I look forward to seeing through these projects (and many more) and continuing to represent local residents and businesses over the next two years.
