This year’s Maranoa Gardens Festival will be held next Saturday 24th August. It is a fantastic opportunity to come along and see the nationally-recognised gardens on your own doorstep, featuring a unique collection of Australian plants.

There will be a number of events and activities featuring in this year’s event, including talks and displays of native animals and tours of the historic gardens.

Created by John Watson in 1901, Maranoa Gardens is one of Australia’s oldest native gardens and has been open to the public since 1926.

The festival will be held on Saturday 24th August from 10am to 3pm.

### Getting there

I would like to encourage visitors to use sustainable transport methods to attend the festival. The frequent 109 tram runs along Whitehorse Road with a tram stop conveniently located only a short 3 minute walk from Maranoa Gardens.

Walking or cycling to and from the festival not only removes the hassle of finding parking, but is good for the environment and your physical and mental health.
