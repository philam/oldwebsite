After a lengthy period of time spent on building both this website and the ‘[Have Your Say!](http://yoursay.philipmallis.com)‘ community voice website, both online resources are now up and running! The rest of the policies will be posted on here as soon as possible.

This will now kick-start the campaign to elect Philip Mallis as councillor of Maranoa Ward in the City of Boroondara, which comprises of areas of Balwyn, North Balwyn and Greythorn.

The ‘Your Say’ website is particularly important, as it will give electors direct, clear and easy access to Philip, who will be answering all questions, concerns and comments directly. We want to hear from you, so please, if you have something to say, please let us know!
