I attended the ‘Meet your Neighbour’ day at Macleay/Myrtle Park today, where there were a number of great activities and ways for members of the local community to come together.

The event ran from around 11:30am to 2:30pm, with many families, kids and other local residents enjoying what was on offer at the event. Federal MP for Kooyong, The Hon. Josh Frydenberg, and Councillor David Bloom for Cotham Ward were present, along with members of the Macleay Myrtle Park Advisory Committee.

The ‘Make Your Own Scarecrow Competition’ was an interesting and close contest, with quite a few great entries. Many people also took advantage of the free barbecue put on by the council, as well as the free native plants (I picked up a ‘Golden Everlasting’ plant).

The event was run and organised by the Macleay Myrtle Park Advisory Committee and Boroondara Council who are to be congratulated for putting on such a great event.
