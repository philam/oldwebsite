I am pleased to announce a new section on this website, consisting of information about Maranoa Ward.

This comprises of a number of webpages containing information on the two suburbs which make up Maranoa Ward – Balwyn and North Balwyn (parts of both). This includes photographs and selected data from the 2011 Census.

Further sections will be published in the near future, including history and a community directory.

The section may be access from the top navigation menu under ‘Maranoa’.
