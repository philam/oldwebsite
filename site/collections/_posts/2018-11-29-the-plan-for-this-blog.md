The few regular followers of this blog will notice that I post content rather sporadically.

This is largely a product of the varying amounts of time that I have available to write over the year. Some weeks allow me to write (or at least start) a few posts, whereas in other weeks I barely have a chance to think about content at all.

Over the new few months at least, I hope to begin posting somewhat more regularly.

I hope to make the ‘[transport tip of the month](https://philipmallis.com/blog/category/transport/transport-tips/)‘ posts more regular as part of this plan. Also on the list is to restructure the blog’s layout to make it more user-friendly.

Splitting my time between my [mapping projects](https://maps.philipmallis.com) and this website is challenging, but I hope to get ahead and automatically schedule posts well in advance so that some modicum of regularity is maintained.

I will initially aim for one post per fortnight, published on a Thursday. Depending on my future time commitments, I may be able to get this up to once per week, but we’ll see how this goes.
