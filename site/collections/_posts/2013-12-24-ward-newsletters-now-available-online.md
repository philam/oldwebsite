For those who are interested, Maranoa Ward newsletters are now available on this website. The latest version is already uploaded to the Boroondara website every time it is published, but here on my website you can see every issue from my term thus far. Each download section also contains a list of stories from each issue, making it easy to navigate.

The newsletters may be found on the top navigation menu under ‘Resources’, or by visiting this link: <http://philipmallis.com/resources/maranoa-ward-newsletters/>

Wishing you all a merry Christmas and a great New Year break!
