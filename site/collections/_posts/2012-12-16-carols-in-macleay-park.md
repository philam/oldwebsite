Yesterday evening the Carols in Macleay Park were held, with a wide variety of activities for young and old. I attended the event along with the councillor for Cotham Ward, Cr. Judith Voce, and the councillor for Bellvue Ward, Cr. Jim Parke. It was a thoroughly enjoyable evening and many thanks must go to the event organisers and sponsors for putting on such a great event.
