Another year, another few thousand photos [uploaded to Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/). Here’s a small selection of some from 2019.

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>I [rode my bike up through Woodlands Park](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/albums/72157712377955908) and the aircraft observation area north of Melbourne Airport – a great place for planespotting!

[![Inside main entrance to Springvale Shopping Centre](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49289873071_186927b6d5_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/49289873071/in/datetaken/ "Inside main entrance to Springvale Shopping Centre")<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script><div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:60px"></div>One of my favourite hikes was to the [Rubicon Valley](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/albums/72157711083607877) in Victoria’s Central Highlands.

[![Country roads](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48802519998_49675ec83a_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48802519998/in/datetaken/ "Country roads")<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script><div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:60px"></div>Although this photo was only taken a few months, the scene at Reservoir Station is [radically different now](https://levelcrossings.vic.gov.au/projects/high-street-reservoir/image-gallery#)!

[![Reservoir level crossing during removal](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48864235857_0416aabe85_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48864235857/in/datetaken/ "Reservoir level crossing during removal")<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script><div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:60px"></div>I [cycled to Manor Lakes](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/albums/72157711006623156) and found the very western edge of Melbourne. It’s almost certainly moved further out by now.

Amongst many other things, I visited the [now-closed Tonsley Station](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48130651498/in/datetaken/), took [my first trip on the O-Bahn](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48085132017/in/datetaken/) and enjoyed the [beautiful architecture](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48085084216/in/datetaken/) that the city has to offer.
