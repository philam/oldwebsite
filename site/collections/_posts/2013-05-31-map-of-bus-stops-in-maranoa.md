Something that I have been working on intermittently for a few months is a map of all bus stops in Maranoa (i.e. parts of Balwyn, North Balwyn and Mont Albert North). Given that there isn’t any map that I could find with specific bus stops on it, I thought that this could be a worthwhile exercise.

The bus routes that run through Maranoa are included (except for school buses), which are: 201, 202, 207, 284, 285 and 302. The 313 and 315 peak services are also included.

I’ve compiled this map using personal observations and Google Streetview, so if there are any errors or corrections that need to be made, please let me know.

Needless to say that this is not an official Ventura Bus or PTV map.
