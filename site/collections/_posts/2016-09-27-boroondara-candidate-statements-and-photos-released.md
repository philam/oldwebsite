*Please read the [Day 1 post](http://philipmallis.com/blog/2016/09/15/day-1-council-elections-2016/) for an introduction and more information.*

Yesterday the VEC released the candidate statements and photos for all candidates who have chosen to submit one or both of these options.

All 33 candidates have submitted both photos and statements (except for one candidate in Gardiner Ward), and they are all now available on the VEC website [here](https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/BoroondaraElection/Candidates/).

## Candidate statements

I have compiled all of the statements as PDF files into a single downloadable .zip file. available [here](https://goo.gl/tkSTFT).

You can also download the statements as individual PDFs below, sorted by ward.
