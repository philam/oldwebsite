The weather cleared long enough for the many hundreds of people who attended today’s [Maranoa Festival](http://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/news/maranoa-festival) at the Maranoa Gardens in Balwyn. There were activities for all age groups and interests, from facepainting to guided tours of the beautiful gardens.

I personally talked to a number of people at the festival about issues that matter to them in the ward and the wider area of Boroondara, and there were a number of very interesting and enlightened responses. As I strongly believe in [real engagement](http://www.naturaledgeproject.net/images/iPlan_000.JPG) with and of the community, rather than merely ‘consulting’, this provided a great opportunity for these issues to be raised.
