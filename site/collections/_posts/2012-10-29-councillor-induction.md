It was a great pleasure to meet my fellow councillors and council staff who I will be working with closely over the next four years. Everyone was friendly, knowledgeable and extremely helpful, so many thanks must go to them.

It was a fascinating day involving tours around the offices, photographs and, of course, the official swearing in of the new council and our first official meeting.

Again, thanks must go to all involved in todayâ€™s events, and I very much look forward to working with them all.
