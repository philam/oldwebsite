Today marked the inaugural North Balwyn Multicultural Festival which was on from 9:00am this morning.

The event, put on jointly by the North Balwyn Rotary Club and North Balwyn Village, was a great success with many people enjoying the great weather and activities on offer. Many local traders were also out in force, which is fantastic for encouraging people to ‘buy local’ and support local businesses.

Josh Frydenberg MP, the federal member for Kooyong, opened with festival with Cr Jim Parke, Boroondara councillor for Bellevue Ward. I attended later during the day.

Some of the many performances included Greek dancing, the Men in Suits Choir and Chinese Ribbon Dancing.

The North Balwyn Rotary Club, North Balwyn Village and all participants are to be congratulated for putting on such a fantastic and successful event. Hopefully this will become a regular event for many years to come.
