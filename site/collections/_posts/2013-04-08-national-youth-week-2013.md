It’s National Youth Week 2013! This is a time to celebrate young people in Australia and the contributions that we make to society, whether it’s volunteering in the community or leading people towards doing great things.

Around 30% of 18-25 year olds volunteer in some capacity, with the rate of volunteering in this age group increasing faster than any other ([source](http://tinyurl.com/cgemeav)). Not only that, but young people are being given more and more opportunities to actively participate in our communities as the years go by. Institutions, governments and the population at large have realised the importance of engaging and, perhaps more importantly, involving young people in decision-making.

The City of Boroondara is hosting a great event on this Saturday 13th April. The Youth Day Festival will involve live entertainment from local bands, screenings from the 2012 Future Visions Youth Film Festival, sports activities and much more. Everyone is welcome to attend!

### Where and when

The festival will run from 11am to 4pm on the 13th April just outside the Camberwell Library at 340 Camberwell Road, Camberwell.

### Getting there

There is limited parking in the area, so taking the bus, tram or train, cycling or walking even part of the way is a much more convenient, cheaper, less stressful and more sustainable way to travel.

There is limited parking available around the library, both on and off-street. There are two main parking areas: one off Inglesby Road just behind the council offices (don’t park in the mayor’s spot!), and another to the west of the library itself.
