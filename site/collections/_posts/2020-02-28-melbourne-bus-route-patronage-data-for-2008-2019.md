The latest installment of my [ongoing publication of transport data](https://philipmallis.com/blog/2019/04/05/melbourne-bus-patronage-data-2008-2017/) for Victoria is two more years of usage data for all bus routes in Melbourne for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 financial years.

Note that I have updated my [existing spreadsheet](https://philipmallis.com/blog/2019/04/05/melbourne-bus-patronage-data-2008-2017/) from a previous post, complete with notes from [Peter Parker](https://melbourneontransit.blogspot.com/), so that you can get a full view of all bus route patronage from 2008 to 2019.

Enjoy!
