As mentioned in [a previous post](https://philipmallis.com/blog/2019/02/14/station-patronage-in-victoria-2013-2018/), I recently acquired station patronage data for Melbourne and Victoria for 2013 to 2018.

This means that we can now play with the data!

One of the first questions that comes up when looking at station usage data is which stations are have the highest and lowest numbers of passengers.

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:30px"></div>### Which is the least used station in Victoria?

It should come as no surprise that the 10 least used stations in the state are all in regional/country Victoria:

| Station | Patronage (yearly) | Line |
|---|---|---|
| Elmore | 884 | Echuca |
| Talbot | 1,121 | Maryborough |
| Creswick | 1,143 | Maryborough |
| Springhurst | 1,566 | Albury |
| Essendon | 1,645 | Seymour |
| Sherwood Park | 1,814 | Warrnambool |
| Avenel | 2,118 | Albury |
| Clunes | 2,136 | Maryborough |
| Berwick | 2,140 | Traralgon |
| Pyramid | 2,670 | Swan Hill |

Elmore takes out the title of being the least used station in Victoria for 2016-17 with 884 recorded boardings – that’s just 2.42 people per day! However, if you look at the data in previous years, it was previously hovering in around seventh place. I don’t know why it was particularly low in 2016-17 – it might be a data error or perhaps a local disruption. If any locals could enlighten us please let me know in the comments below!

On the metropolitan network, there are few surprises in the least used station data.

All nine stations on the Stony Point Line almost entirely comprise the list of ten least used stations on the metropolitan network.

For the purposes of the table below, I have excluded them and begun with the least-used station on the electrified network instead:

| Station | Patronage (yearly) | Line |
|---|---|---|
| Wattle Glen | 52,664 | Hurstbridge |
| Tecoma | 56,636 | Belgrave |
| Officer | 75,877 | Pakenham |
| Willison | 97,248 | Alamein |
| Seaholme | 103,446 | Werribee |
| Upwey | 125,371 | Belgrave |
| Alamein | 133,093 | Alamein |
| Hurstbridge | 140,518 | Hurstbridge |
| Diggers Rest | 142,198 | Sunbury |
| Darebin | 145,776 | Hurstbridge |

Wattle Glen comes out as the least used station on the metropolitan electrified network for 2016-17 with 52,664 passengers (143.89 per day).

Including the Stony Point Line, Baxter comes out as the least used with 4,696 yearly passengers (12.83 per day).

In many previous years, up until about 2013-14, Wattle Glen was second to Officer as the least used station in Melbourne (excluding the Stony Point Line). Due to the rapid growth in that area, Officer’s patronage has increased from 21,479 in 2008-09 to 91,956 in 2017-18.

A note on this metropolitan data – I have 2017-18 data as well but have opted to only include the 2016-17 data in this post. This is to ensure accurate comparison with V/Line data which only goes up to 2016-17.

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:30px"></div>### Which is the most used station in Victoria?

Once again, we will start with the V/Line statistics.

Unsurprisingly, Southern Cross Station is by far the most used station on the regional train network with 6,612,020 passengers per year (2016-17).

However, some of the other most used stations may surprise you:

| Station | Patronage (yearly) - V/Line only | Line |
|---|---|---|
| Southern Cross | 6,612,020 | Multiple |
| Tarneit | 887,566 | Geelong |
| Melton | 726,339 | Ballarat |
| Geelong | 716,314 | Geelong |
| Footscray | 636,013 | Multiple |
| Ballarat | 604,115 | Ballarat |
| Wyndham Vale | 541,400 | Geelong |
| South Geelong | 527,263 | Geelong |
| Bendigo | 407,417 | Bendigo |
| Lara | 320,915 | Geelong |

For metropolitan Melbourne, the numbers get much higher. Again unsurprisingly, Flinders Street Station comes out on top with 27,859,333 passengers per year (2016-17):

| Station | Patronage (yearly) - V/Line only | Line |
|---|---|---|
| Flinders Street | 27,859,333 | Multiple |
| Southern Cross | 17,470,740 | Multiple |
| Melbourne Central | 15,724,183 | Multiple |
| Parliament | 9,855,426 | Multiple |
| Footscray | 5,100,122 | Multiple |
| Flagstaff | 4,645,648 | Multiple |
| Caulfield | 4,544,747 | Multiple |
| South Yarra | 4,517,462 | Multiple |
| Richmond | 3,803,562 | Multiple |
| Box Hill | 3,769,046 | Belgrave/Lilydale |

It’s interesting that Box Hill makes it into the top 10 most used stations as it is not an interchange between rail lines. However, it does have a [large bus interchange](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/37102948812/) with frequent services from all directions. According to the latest station access statistics, 2,931 people (26.2 percent) use a bus to get to Box Hill Station every day. This is the second highest in Melbourne – only behind Huntingdale.

### Data notes

I will qualify the analysis above with a few notes.

The metropolitan station data include all station entrances and exits – including V/Line and interstate passengers where applicable. The V/Line data is regional passengers only.

This data also does not take into account passengers interchanging (particularly at places like Richmond), staff opening myki gates during disruptions, fare evasion or other irregularities. The gate configuration at Caulfield also leads to an overestimate of patronage, as with previous numbers.

Other notes and details on data collection may be found in the original spreadsheets, available [here](https://philipmallis.com/blog/2019/02/14/station-patronage-in-victoria-2013-2018/).
