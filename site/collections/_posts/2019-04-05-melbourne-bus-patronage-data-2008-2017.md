*Download the data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rf0B74BxwkBedQ8RExe0W0r5Rto6_7cu/view?usp=sharing). Update 8 April 2019: Peter Parker over at [Melbourne On Transit](https://melbourneontransit.blogspot.com) has kindly added extensive notes to the spreadsheet (which has now been updated).*

Last year I requested bus route patronage data from Public Transport Victoria.

They obliged quickly (no FOI request needed) but I totally forgot to publish the information.

You can download the compiled bus route patronage data from 2008 to 2017 [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rf0B74BxwkBedQ8RExe0W0r5Rto6_7cu/view?usp=sharing).

Please note that the FY2017-18 data only includes route information up to 31 December 2017.

### Data

As with the [railway station data](https://philipmallis.com/blog/2019/02/14/station-patronage-in-victoria-2013-2018/), compiling this into a comprehensive and useable file took quite some time. I had to amalgamate four spreadsheets covering different years. They were also laid out in different formats which didn’t make it any easier.

Many routes have been abolished, created or had their numbers reused in other areas. I have tried my best to clean the data to avoid erroneous myki programming (e.g. some touch ons are still showing up as being from the 202, several years after it was removed).

If anyone finds any additional notes or issues with the data, please let me know.

I will also request the rest of the 2017-18 and 2018-19 data from PTV at the end of this financial year for both buses and railway stations. This sheet will then be updated with the new information. Once that’s done, I’ll publish a new post.

Enjoy!
