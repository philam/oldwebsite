I have recently acquired patronage data for all railway stations in Victoria between 2013-2018.

After requests to Public Transport Victoria and V/Line were answered last week, I compiled this data into two spreadsheets for your viewing pleasure:

- [V/Line station patronage 2013 â€“ 2017](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KexrKIt8iMqW2qVamgTJ1FWkm63NUBfT/view?usp=sharing)
- [Metropolitan station patraonge 2014-2018](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E1sDXTMRQ9uXYQdV6XAO0W2iZA8f54v2/view?usp=sharing)

I will be writing a series of posts interrogating this data more closely over the coming weeks.

Enjoy!
