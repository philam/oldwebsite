The Victorian Government is developing a new Metropolitan Planning Strategy and has recently released a [discussion paper](http://www.planmelbourne.vic.gov.au/discussion-paper) on the project. This allows local councils, organisations and individuals to make submissions on the paper.

The City of Boroondara will be making its own submission on behalf of council, but everyone is invited to give their own feedback on this important planning document.

For more information on the paper and on Councilâ€™s response, please visit: [http://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/your\_council/your-say/metropolitan-planning-strategy](http://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/your_council/your-say/metropolitan-planning-strategy)
