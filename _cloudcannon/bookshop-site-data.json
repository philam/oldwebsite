The turnout was fantastic, with people packing the church for the service and the rear hall afterwards for morning tea.</p>\n\n<p>St. Columba’s is one of six Uniting Church properties in Boroondara that have been sold, with five out of the total six being in my ward (<a href=\"http://philipmallis.com/maranoa/\" title=\"Maranoa\">Maranoa Ward</a>). These are:</p>\n\n<p>[list type=arrow_list]</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>St Columba’s church, hall, tennis courts &amp; kindergarten (37 Banool Road, Balwyn VIC 3103)</li>\n  <li>St Columba’s adjacent dwelling (25 Banool Road, Balwyn VIC 3103)</li>\n  <li>Trinity Uniting Church, hall &amp; dwelling (172 Doncaster Road, 47 Sutton Street &amp; 49 Sutton Street, Balwyn North VIC 3104)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>[/list]</p>\n\n<p>The other Uniting Church property in Boroondara that has been sold are the tennis courts at 20A Broughton Road.

Many people of all ages and locations attended, including past ministers, congregation members and Sunday school students. St Columba’s has a rich and vibrant history, including being the first in its parish to appoint a female minister, the operation of a hugely popular Sunday school and the St Columba’s Kindergarten.</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards I spoke with committee members, ministers and other attendees, with some having travelled long distances to be there today. While there was understandable grief and anger with what has occurred, many were looking forward to the future and its opportunities for positive change and renewal.</p>\n\n<p>There was discussion about the future of the many community groups who have used the church facilities for many years. The sale of the church and its buildings is not just a loss for the congregation, but a loss for the wider community. The benefit to the local area was translated through the provision of valuable space for groups to be able to carry out their work, from Scottish dancing to a women’s choir. The benefits from these activities extended far beyond the immediate congregation, and the church’s loss will be felt by many.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks must go to the church’s committee members, ministers and congregation members for their hard work and dedication over the years to provide such valuable services to the community. While I am not religious nor a churchgoer myself, it is easy to see how much this hidden suburban church has meant to people and what a difference it has made to hundreds of people’s lives. I wish all the very best for the future.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2014/04/27/st-columbas-church-90th-anniversary-and-closing-service","relative_path":"_posts/2014-04-27-st-columbas-church-90th-anniversary-and-closing-service.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["News"],"layout":"post","id":806,"title":"Latest ward update now available online","date":"2014-05-13 18:58:18 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"http://philipmallis.com/?p=806","incr_sidebar_layout":["right-sidebar"],"incr_sidebar_set":["sidebar"],"incr_feattype":["show_thumb"],"ks_metadata":["a:7:{s:4:\"lang\";s:2:\"en\";s:8:\"keywords\";s:0:\"\";s:19:\"keywords_autoupdate\";i:1;s:11:\"description\";s:0:\"\";s:22:\"description_autoupdate\";i:1;s:5:\"title\";s:0:\"\";s:6:\"robots\";s:12:\"index,follow\";}"],"slug":"latest-ward-update-now-available-online","ext":".md","tags":[],"excerpt":"<p>The latest Maranoa Ward update is now available to read online: <a href=\"http://philipmallis.com/resources/maranoa-ward-newsletters/\">http://philipmallis.com/resources/maranoa-ward-newsletters/</a></p>\n","content":"<p>The latest Maranoa Ward update is now available to read online: <a href=\"http://philipmallis.com/resources/maranoa-ward-newsletters/\">http://philipmallis.com/resources/maranoa-ward-newsletters/</a></p>\n\n<p>Some story highlights include:</p>\n\n<p>[list type=arrow_list]</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <div>Boroondara Sports Complex update</div>\n  </li>\n  <li>Rotary Club of North Balwyn</li>\n  <li>Upgrade to Balwyn Evergreen Centre</li>\n  <li>Amendment C108 update</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>[/list]</p>\n","url":"/blog/2014/05/13/latest-ward-update-now-available-online","relative_path":"_posts/2014-05-14-latest-ward-update-now-available-online.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport"],"layout":"post","id":815,"title":"Public transport changes are here","date":"2014-07-27 07:27:36 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"http://philipmallis.com/?p=815","incr_sidebar_layout":["right-sidebar"],"incr_sidebar_set":["sidebar"],"incr_feattype":["show_thumb"],"ks_metadata":["a:7:{s:4:\"lang\";s:2:\"en\";s:8:\"keywords\";s:51:\"bus,changes,route,services,207,frequencies,kew,live\";s:19:\"keywords_autoupdate\";i:1;s:11:\"description\";s:155:\"bus, tram, train and regional services.

If you live along the 200/207 routes and wish to travel to Kew, Collingwood, Parkville or the city, the changes are a significant improvement on the existing timetables. The improved frequencies on these routes will mean that buses will come more often are more times during the day, especially on weekends. For instance, at present there are 90 minute Sunday frequencies on the 207 route. Under the new timetable, this is improved to 30 minute frequencies. However, if you live on High Street between Kew Junction and Burke Road, or anywhere along Belmore Road, you may find that the number of possible destinations have shrunk significantly.</p>\n\n<p>With the abolition of the 201, there will be no service to the University of Melbourne, Brunswick, Collingwood or Kew Junction without interchanging onto 200/207 services at the intersection of Hoddle and Johnston Streets. The removal of the 203 route also means that there will no longer be any bus service along the northern end of Princess Street, nor any freeway services that travel along Johnston Street.

While we prepare for the impending rate capping in the next financial year, Council has been able to include a rate rise reduction to 4.5% while maintaining and improving services.</p>\n\n<p>Locally, Maranoa Ward continues to significantly benefit with many projects being approved for the area. These include:</p>\n\n<p><strong>North Balwyn Tennis Club pavilion renewal</strong> – $200,000 to complete the renewal of the pavilion at the North Balwyn Tennis Club off Buchanan Avenue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hislop Park drain relining</strong> – $400,000 to reline the significant drains under and near Hislop Park in North Balwyn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Boroondara Sports Complex redevelopment</strong> – $300,000 to complete the Boroondara Sports Complex project involving the demolition of the Balwyn Leisure Centre and the relocation of the centre’s services to new facilities in the Boroondara Sports Complex. This is due to be finished by May 2016.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Balwyn Shopping Centre side crossings</strong> – $70,000 for further side street crossing improvements in the Balwyn Shopping Centre. These typically involve landscaping, raised pavements and safety improvements for pedestrians.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Balwyn, Balwyn North &amp; Deepdene Heritage Study</strong> – $38,569 to complete this important heritage study covering properties in a wide area in the north-eastern part of Boroondara. So far the study has identified 27 potential individual heritage properties and four potential heritage precincts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Greythorn Tennis Club pavilion</strong> – $100,000 to complete the renewal of the pavilion at the Greythorn Tennis Club pavilion in Greythorn Park which is due to be finished later this year in August.</p>\n\n<p>Projects beneficial to local residents are not limited to ward boundaries. There are many other significant projects occurring on or close to the boundaries of Maranoa Ward including:</p>\n\n<p><strong>North-East Community Hub:</strong> $100,000 to continue consultation and design work for the new community hub in North Balwyn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Balwyn Library redevelopment:</strong> $203,900 to complete consultation and design work for the redevelopment of the Balwyn Library on Whitehorse Road in Balwyn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>North Balwyn Men’s Shed:</strong> $200,000 to work with the North Balwyn Rotary Club and North Balwyn Bowling Club for a Men’s Shed at the latter’s location on Buchanan Avenue in North Balwyn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Balwyn Community Centre redevelopment:</strong> $100,000 to begin the redevelopment of the current site on Whitehorse Road in Balwyn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Balwyn Park Master Plan implementation:</strong> $227,000 to commence the development of the former Balwyn Park Bowls Club pavilion into a new tennis and community facility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Balwyn East Kindergarten:</strong> $25,000 for air-conditioning of the buildings in Minifie Park, Balwyn.</p>\n\n<p>Sincere thanks must go to the council officers who have put a lot of work into preparing this lengthy and detailed document, as well as the community for their input during the budget process.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a link to the full budget: <a href=\"http://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/-/media/Files/Your%20Council/Meetings%20and%20Agendas/Council/20150622/Report5%20Adoption%20of%20Budget.pdf\">http://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/-/media/Files/Your%20Council/Meetings%20and%20Agendas/Council/20150622/Report5%20Adoption%20of%20Budget.pdf</a></p>\n","url":"/blog/2015/06/22/council-passes-2015-16-budget-for-boroondara","relative_path":"_posts/2015-06-23-council-passes-2015-16-budget-for-boroondara.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["News"],"layout":"post","id":910,"title":"&#8216;Pop up&#8217; council coming to North Balwyn","date":"2015-09-01 04:29:37 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"http://philipmallis.com/?p=910","ks_metadata":["a:7:{s:4:\"lang\";s:2:\"en\";s:8:\"keywords\";s:62:\"council,saturday,12th,balwyn,centre,councillors,greythorn,idea\";s:19:\"keywords_autoupdate\";i:1;s:11:\"description\";s:158:\"Council is trialing a new idea that came out of our recent community innovation tournament.

Until today, I had managed to avoid any issues with them.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I was riding home from uni down High Street in Kew East on what was/is a very wet day. A large truck had pulled up in front of me (riding between the tram tracks) and then moved into the left lane to let traffic overtake.</p>\n\n<p>Overtaking trucks, 4WDs and other large vehicles is important for motorbikes/scooters/bicycles because of limited visibility to oncoming traffic. This fear is borne out by the fact that the highest number of crashes in a single category are <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/Crashstatfacts/Crashfacts?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=yes&amp;:showTabs=y\">side impacts at intersections</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid being hit at the dangerous Belford Road/High Street intersection, I overtook the truck in the right lane and intended to go straight on at Harp Junction. This involves merging back into the left lane and over tram tracks. This section of the road is also quite steep, requiring acceleration.</p>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m0!3m2!1sen!2sau!4v1464242459130!6m8!1m7!1sZ_Ap7NL6hoHTxoIaQ3tWVQ!2m2!1d-37.7999073!2d145.049303!3f83.4362100224747!4f-18.037227627899483!5f0.7820865974627469\" style=\"border: 0;\" width=\"600\"></iframe>\n\n<p>The combined factors of rain, acceleration and the tram tracks resulted in my back tyre slipping on the metal. I accelerated further and turned to the left trying to regain stability, but this was unfortunately in vain. I fell on my right and was dragged along the road for about 4-5 seconds, starting at about 50-55 km/h (I ride slower in the rain/wind).</p>\n\n<p>Credit must go to the driver of the black 4WD behind me who was driving to the conditions and had left enough spacing between her and I that she didn’t run me over when I went down. She was also the only one who stopped to see if I was ok, so thank you to her for being considerate and driving safely.</p>\n\n<p>I am unhurt, other than graze on my right knee, a sprained ankle and my pride. My scooter has some additional cosmetic features on its right side and the rear vision mirror was broken off (a fact that I didn’t realise until I tried adjusting it later), and part of my rain jacket was torn.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://philipmallis.com/nextgen-attach_to_post/preview/id--1049\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>I should add that I always wear full protective gear, including a full-face helmet, body armour, reinforced riding gloves and kevlar jeans, and the jeans almost certainly saved most of my leg’s skin from the bitumen.</p>\n\n<p>In the photos below, you can see how the water from the road surface got through to the pants I was wearing underneath (right) but the jeans (left) took the brunt of the drag.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://philipmallis.com/nextgen-attach_to_post/preview/id--1030\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>An instructive lesson in the importance of wearing the right gear if there ever was one.</p>\n\n<p>So, what did we learn (or tl;dr)?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Tram tracks are awful in the wet</strong> – remember to always cross at a minimum of a 45 degree angle, but even this is no guarantee of safety. Ride to the conditions and look ahead to minimise the number of times you need to cross.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>It is vital to leave adequate stopping distance</strong> – if the 4WD had been closer to me, grazing my knee would be the least of my problems. Remember that scooters, motorbikes and bicycles take longer to stop than cars, especially when it is wet or windy, so leave that little bit of extra room.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Always wear full protective gear</strong> – it’s no good if you wear only part of the full suite of protective gear. If you only wear a helmet and gloves, that’s not going to help much if you come off at 60 km/h and scrape your leg along the ground for 5-6 seconds (you won’t have much skin left). Conversely, it’s no good if you wear a helmet and kevlar jeans. If you come off and stick your hands out to break your fall, you won’t have much of your hand left either. Each piece of gear is designed to do a different job, so make sure you’re always wearing them.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n","url":"/blog/2016/05/26/today-my-scooter-had-an-argument-with-some-tram-tracks-and-lost","relative_path":"_posts/2016-05-26-today-my-scooter-had-an-argument-with-some-tram-tracks-and-lost.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["2016 Victorian Council Elections"],"layout":"post","id":1096,"title":"Day 1: Council Elections 2016","date":"2016-09-15 06:28:09 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"http://philipmallis.com/?p=1096","slide_template":["default"],"incr_sidebar_layout":["right-sidebar"],"incr_sidebar_set":["sidebar"],"incr_feattype":["show_thumb"],"tags":["2016","Council"],"slug":"day-1-council-elections-2016","ext":".md","excerpt":"<h2 id=\"a-brief-introduction\">A brief introduction</h2>\n","content":"<h2 id=\"a-brief-introduction\">A brief introduction</h2>\n\n<p>Here we finally are at Day 1 of the 2016 local government elections for Victoria. I will be posting here over the course of the next few weeks to keep you all updated on what is happening in the world of local politics. Obviously I will be focussing on Boroondara, but I will try to get to other areas and a broad overview as well.</p>\n\n<p>I come at this topic from my perspective as someone with a keen interest in politics and local history. I have spent many years researching my local area, in particular past councillors in the 140+ years of local government in Boroondara (see <a href=\"http://boroondarawiki.org\">BoroondaraWiki</a> for my current project). This may explain some of the character of future posts.</p>\n\n<p>I should at declare at the outset that I am a current councillor at Boroondara. As such, I do know many councillors and candidates personally both here and across Victoria. However, I will remain as objective as possible in my writing (it will mainly be number crunching with limited commentary anyway). I should also add that everything on here is in my capacity as an individual, and does not represent the views of the City of Boroondara or any other person/entity.</p>\n\n<p>Why do this at all? Compared to state and federal levels, there is limited coverage of local elections. Consequently, voters and future historians are not necessarily as informed as they otherwise would be with more information about what is happening. With the knowledge and experience of four years as an elected representative, I would like to put this to good use in helping to bridge this gap.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"nominations-open\">Nominations open</h2>\n\n<p>So, to business. Today marked the opening of nominations for 78 council elections being conducted across Victoria, and many have already put their hand up. This year for the first time, the <a href=\"https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/Elections/2016LocalCouncilElectionsNominations.html\">VEC is posting</a> the names and contact details of nominees as they come in on their website. Frankly, this is a welcome innovation for psephologists and voters alike, making it far easier to see who has nominated before ballots are posted.</p>\n\n<p>A table with a full list of candidates who nominated today may be found below.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"boroondara-nominees-at-conclusion-of-15-september-2016\">Boroondara nominees at conclusion of 15 September 2016</h3>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"346\" loading=\"lazy\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=415EA741177EF59B&amp;resid=415EA741177EF59B%2113305&amp;authkey=AIND6D0Ba0zYQnc&amp;em=2&amp;wdAllowInteractivity=False&amp;ActiveCell='Sheet1'!A1&amp;wdHideGridlines=True&amp;wdHideHeaders=True\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n<p>There were some other names on the list today, but they were taken down shortly afterwards for some reason.</p>\n\n<p>Nominations for all wards are open until 12 noon on Tuesday 20 September.

It involves submitting the candidate nomination form, candidate questionnaire and other relevant documents in person at an appointed time and date with the returning officer. There is a $250 fee, but this is returned if the candidate polls above 4% or is declared elected.</p>\n\n<p>For the past two elections, the VEC has included a ‘candidate helper’ which allows users to pre-fill forms and speed up their submission. The returning officer for Boroondara confirmed that the helper generates a barcode that allows officials at the electoral office to simply scan the form into their internal system rather than having to manually enter data.</p>\n\n<p>One other change for this year is the requirement that candidates must lodge their nomination forms in person. In previous years, it was possible for the candidate to authorise another person to submit their nomination on their behalf. This was changed for this year, possibly to help cut down on ‘dummy’ candidates, who would often be nominated all at once by the ‘real’ candidate.</p>\n\n<p>The full nomination process and more information is available on the <a href=\"https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/CandidatesAndParties/BecomingCouncilCandidate.html\">VEC website here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"nominations\">Nominations</h2>\n\n<p>A few more more nominations have been published today.

At the end of August, the Legislative Council voted to disallow Clause 38 of the Local Government (Electoral) Regulations 2016.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, this has removed the indication of preferences for inclusion in the ballot pack mailed to voters as has occurred in previous elections (see below for an example from the 2012 election). The change does not prohibit candidates from distributing their own preferences. On the contrary, it will probably make such individual notices and ‘how to vote’ cards more prevalent now that the candidates will have to find other ways to make their preferences known.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_6777-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Preferences indications 2012 election\" /></p>\n\n<p>The mover of the motion, Liberal David Davis, <a href=\"http://www.latrobevalleyexpress.com.au/story/4150318/make-up-your-own-mind-on-council-election-preferences/\">said that the changes</a> would help to deter dummy candidates from being used. The Nationals and the Greens also supported the move. However, this was <a href=\"http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/council-regulations-repeal-bad-news-for-voters/\">not received well</a> by Labor, saying that it would cause confusion for voters. They stopped short of calling it a bad idea, instead blaming the Liberals for not implementing the idea when they were last in government.</p>\n\n<p>One other interesting point to note is that the disallowance motion does not necessarily mean that preferences cannot be included as before. With the changes made by the motion, the <em>Local Government Act</em> is now silent on the matter of the inclusion of preferences in ballot packs, meaning that it is not necessarily prohibited. The VEC has taken the view that it will not accept preference indications, but this is an issue that may well be taken up in the future.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_6778-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"VEC preferences notice\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"nominations\">Nominations</h2>\n\n<p>As tomorrow is the final day for candidates to nominate (by 12 noon), I would expect quite a few to put themselves down tomorrow. Some candidates wait until the very last minute to nominate in the hope that they can find a ward where the incumbent is not standing or there are fewer candidates running.</p>\n\n<p>This is made possible by there being no regulation on having to live or be a ratepayer in the ward in which you stand. Rather, you are only required to be a resident or ratepayer within the entire council area.</p>\n\n<p>Nominations made today are in the table below, followed by a running record of the nominees so far.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"boroondara-nominees-on-19-september-2016\">Boroondara nominees on 19 September 2016</h3>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" loading=\"lazy\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=415EA741177EF59B&amp;resid=415EA741177EF59B%2113356&amp;authkey=AP7MtqntAhuvPus&amp;em=2&amp;wdAllowInteractivity=False&amp;ActiveCell='Sheet1'!A1&amp;wdHideGridlines=True&amp;wdHideHeaders=True\" width=\"600\"></iframe>\n\n<h3 id=\"boroondara-candidates-total-as-of-19-september-2016\">Boroondara candidates (total) as of 19 September 2016</h3>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250\" loading=\"lazy\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=415EA741177EF59B&amp;resid=415EA741177EF59B%2113357&amp;authkey=ACc7AX-e_JIAAng&amp;em=2&amp;wdAllowInteractivity=False&amp;ActiveCell='Sheet1'!A1&amp;wdHideGridlines=True&amp;wdHideHeaders=True\" width=\"600\"></iframe>\n","url":"/blog/2016/09/19/day-5-council-elections-2016","relative_path":"_posts/2016-09-19-day-5-council-elections-2016.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["2016 Victorian Council Elections","Local government"],"layout":"post","id":1118,"title":"Day 6: Council Elections 2016 &#8211; Nominations close, ballot order revealed","date":"2016-09-20 02:00:38 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"http://philipmallis.com/?p=1118","slide_template":["default"],"incr_sidebar_layout":["right-sidebar"],"incr_sidebar_set":["sidebar"],"incr_feattype":["show_thumb"],"tags":["2016","Boroondara","Council"],"slug":"day-6-council-elections-2016-nominations-close-ballot-order-revealed","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>Welcome to Day 6 of the 2016 council elections!

ballot packs will be mailed out to eligible properties in Boroondara and the other councils in Victoria using postal elections.</p>\n\n<p>As per VEC regulations, no more than 35% of ballots can be posted on any one day. Packs are sent by priority mail, but with the recent Australia Post changes, there may be delays in some properties receiving their packs.</p>\n\n<p>In response to this, some of the electoral changes for this election included provisions to allow for election offices to accept ballot packs up to 12 noon on the fifth working day after the last day of voting, provided that the Returning Officer is satisfied that it was posted before 6pm on Friday 21 October. Counting and declaration of results has also been delayed to account for these changes.</p>\n\n<p>For my part, I would highly recommend that you vote early. This should help to avoid any potential problems with late voting later on and will also make sure that you don’t forget (which happens to the best of us).</p>\n\n<p>Remember that voting is compulsory and that there are penalties for not casting your ballot.</p>\n\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1145\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1145\" style=\"width: 653px\">[![Solway results 2012 - your vote counts!](http://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/solway-1024x257.png)](https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/Results/BoroondaraResult2012.html#e9)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1145\">Results for [Solway Ward (2012)](https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/Results/BoroondaraResult2012.html#e9) – every vote counts, so make sure you cast yours</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"before-you-vote\">Before you vote!</h2>\n\n<p>But wait! Before you decide which boxes to number, make sure that you making an informed decision.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t rely solely on the 200-word candidate statement and photo to make your decision. While they can be useful sources of information, I highly recommend that you conduct your own research into each candidate and their policies.</p>\n\n<p>This may be something as simple as a quick search on Google, which will takes minimal effort and time on your part. Most, if not all, candidates have some sort of online presence, such as a Facebook page or website.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in previous posts, this election also features <a href=\"http://philipmallis.com/blog/2016/09/24/boroondara-candidate-questionnaire-responses-released/\">questionnaires</a> that each candidate has had the option to complete, which are available on the <a href=\"https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/BoroondaraElection/Candidates/\">VEC website</a>. While some candidates have chosen not to fill out the questionnaires, they can be a useful source of information.</p>\n\n<p>These resources, along with anything else you might find, can reveal useful information that will help you decide how to cast your vote.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-vote\">How to vote</h2>\n\n<p>Council elections use a preferential voting system. Unlike New South Wales and some other jurisdictions, <strong>you must number every box for your vote to be counted</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Number all candidates by writing a number in the box next to each candidate’s name, beginning from ‘1’ (most preferred) until you have numbered every box.</p>\n\n<p>Also remember that even if candidates have distributed ‘how to vote’ cards or suggested other ways to number boxes, you are not obliged to follow their instructions. You are of course able to cast your vote as recommended, but you are also free to number each box however you like.</p>\n\n<p>If in doubt, the instructions on your VEC ballot will contain details and more information. The <a href=\"http://vec.vic.gov.au\">VEC website</a> and phone service (13 18 32) will also be of use.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, be informed, vote early and know that every vote counts.

I have been constantly amazed at people’s energy and interest in local issues, even if I have not always agreed with them. The constant contact from residents and business owners living and working across Balwyn, North Balwyn and Mont Albert has kept me constantly informed and on my toes.</p>\n\n<p>I would also like to sincerely thank all of the council officers at Boroondara. I have had the pleasure of working with many over the past four years and seen first-hand how everyone contributes in some way to the smooth running of the municipality. I am very grateful for all of the kind assistance provided to me along the way.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I would like to acknowledge my fellow councillors. I have learned an immeasurable amount from everybody and I am also very grateful for the help and support. This was especially invaluable in my first year in this position when I was beginning to learn about council and its operations.</p>\n\n<p>Despite appearances to the contrary, politics is not an undertaking for one person alone. It is vital to have the support other people to make your time worthwhile and have a lasting impact. For this reason, I would like to again acknowledge and sincerely thank everybody who has given me support and guidance. It would not have been possible without you all. I am proud of the legacy that we have left behind and know that we have made a positive and lasting difference to the community that will benefit people for many years to come.</p>\n\n<p>I have thoroughly enjoyed the past four years representing the neighbourhood where I have grown up and spent most of my life. It has been an absolute honour and privilege that I am very grateful to have experienced. I will cherish the many memories from this time and look forward to remaining involved in local issues in different capacities.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2016/10/10/after-four-years-my-time-on-council-is-coming-to-an-end","relative_path":"_posts/2016-10-11-after-four-years-my-time-on-council-is-coming-to-an-end.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Local government"],"layout":"post","id":1154,"title":"Clearing my council desk","date":"2016-10-17 17:25:25 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"http://philipmallis.com/?p=1154","slide_template":["default"],"incr_sidebar_layout":["right-sidebar"],"incr_sidebar_set":["sidebar"],"incr_feattype":["show_thumb"],"tags":["2016","Council"],"slug":"clearing-my-council-desk","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>When I was first elected in 2012, I anticipated keeping a clean desk with good administrative order.

Here is my summary of the day.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cotham-ward\">Cotham Ward</h3>\n\n<p>First preference counting was over by about 4pm, with the following first preference results (in ballot order):</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Felicity Sinfield – 3,608</li>\n  <li>Phillip Gahn – 842</li>\n  <li>Kieron Long – 882</li>\n  <li>Elliot Watson – 621</li>\n  <li>Judith Voce – 2,183</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The total number of votes counted was 8,338 (with 239 informal votes). Of course these numbers are preliminary and do not reflect the final result, but things aren’t looking too good for Judith Voce (the incumbent).

Compared to most of the other rail trails and paths that I have ridden, this one had very good wayfinding at the railway station. There were signs on the platform and near the station entrance directing people to the beginning of the trail (although it did involve cycling through a busy carpark).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/33349516646/in/album-72157677833666554/\" title=\"Sign marking the start of the Lilydale-Warburton Rail Trail, Lilydale\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3953/33349516646_0d85625a0e.jpg\" alt=\"Sign marking the start of the Lilydale-Warburton Rail Trail, Lilydale\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The trail meandered a little past a school and along a sealed path before turning into lilydale topping for the next few kilometres. This part is quite high along the climb up to Mount Evelyn and has some great views across Lilydale and Chirnside Park.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/33262372331/in/album-72157677833666554/\" title=\"View across Lilydale from Lilydale-Warburton Rail Trail\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2859/33262372331_884a6fe214.jpg\" alt=\"View across Lilydale from Lilydale-Warburton Rail Trail\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Due to the essentially rural nature of this area, the trail is also quite commonly used by horses. There were some signs (and lots of horse poo) indicating such usage and some interesting infrastructure. One such example was this elevated beg button at a signalled road crossing specifically designed so that horseriders did not have to dismount to cross the road (either that or Mount Evelyn has some very tall people).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/32575973063/in/album-72157677833666554/\" title=\"Pedestrian crossing button for horse riders, Mount Evelyn\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2845/32575973063_2c70e3dddd_z.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrian crossing button for horse riders, Mount Evelyn\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>After Mount Evelyn, the trail begins its long descent. The path is still unsealed at this point which greatly reduces the speed that a bicycle could safely traverse the area. It is beautiful scenery through this section where shallow cuttings allow the vegetation to come right up to the edges of the path and create a tunnel-like visual effect.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/33234259942/in/album-72157677833666554/\" title=\"Lilydale-Warburton Rail Trail, Mount Evelyn\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2821/33234259942_819885fa56.jpg\" alt=\"Lilydale-Warburton Rail Trail, Mount Evelyn\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Once we had reached the bottom of the hill, the landscape changed to more open fields and farmland. It was very picturesque looking across to the surrounding hills and forests along this section, past Wandin North and Woori Yallock.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/33234249412/in/datetaken/\" title=\"View across the Yarra Valley from the bike path\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2817/33234249412_9eb7aa7584.jpg\" alt=\"View across the Yarra Valley from the bike path\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"woori-yallock--warburton\">Woori Yallock – Warburton</h2>\n\n<p>After another uncontrolled crossing of the Warburton Highway after Launching Place, we had a bit of an accident on the path. Gravel had piled up on the side of the path and caused us both to come off and onto the ground. While there are some advantages to unsealed paths, hazards like this have to be taken into consideration when designing and using bike infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/33262326821/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Skid marks from bike accident\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3810/33262326821_50ea4fe515_z.jpg\" alt=\"Skid marks from bike accident\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>We stopped at Yarra Junction for some bandaids and generally clean ourselves up. The toilet and seating facilities along the trail are generally very good and well spaced. My only gripe in terms of supporting infrastructure was a lack of drinking fountains. There weren’t that many along the entire trail and those that we did find were not obvious or signed. Something to improve on for the future of the trail.</p>\n\n<p>After another five kilometres or so of riding, we came to the beginning of the last section of the trail – which was sealed! After riding 30 kilometres along gravel and dirt the smooth asphalt felt like being on air. This took us around the side of the valley into Warburton itself and the end of the path. Technically it goes a little bit further east to La La but the rail trail proper officially ends here.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/32547159604/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Park in the centre of Warburton\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/572/32547159604_92fdfce544.jpg\" alt=\"Park in the centre of Warburton\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"warburton--lilydale\">Warburton – Lilydale</h2>\n\n<p>The trip back was much the same (other than an absence of any injuries). We stopped a few more times and found more of the closed infrastructure that supported this railway. Many of the old station platforms and buildings have been repurposed. One of these is in Mount Evelyn where the old station building has been converted into a community house and restored to its former glory.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/33234234832/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Closed Mount Evelyn Railway Station\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/588/33234234832_740acc405b.jpg\" alt=\"Closed Mount Evelyn Railway Station\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Arriving back at Lilydale Station, the old track leading to Healesville/Warburton is still visible just beyond the fence of the current Metro stabling yards. A couple of old signal posts and signs also remain near the bus depot.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/32575905573/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Old tracks for Warburton Railway Line past Lilydale Railway Station\"><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/738/32575905573_d4469366a3.jpg\" alt=\"Old tracks for Warburton Railway Line past Lilydale Railway Station\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>With all of its advantages, it is obvious why this is such a popular route. It is well-signed, well-maintained (largely thanks to the hard work of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Friends-of-Lilydale-to-Warburton-Rail-Trail-123742784367895/\">Friends of Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail</a>) and very scenic. Its grades are also not very steep and friendly for people of all cycling strengths and abilities.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to ride the trail, my advice would be to take a bike that is more suitable for off-road riding. Most of the path is unsealed and riding with thin tyres (like I did) makes the journey more difficult than it needs to be.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2017/03/16/bicycle-trip-lilydale-to-warburton-rail-trail","relative_path":"_posts/2017-03-17-bicycle-trip-lilydale-to-warburton-rail-trail.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Walks"],"layout":"post","id":1664,"title":"Walking in Wandong Regional Park","date":"2017-10-15 18:04:37 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=1664","tags":["2017","Heathcote Junction","Wandong","Wandong Regional Park"],"slug":"walking-in-wandong-regional-park","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>One of the good features about Victoria’s fare system is the <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/fares/travel-benefits/\">weekend cap</a>.

This makes many trips into the nearby countryside around Melbourne very cheap. Wandong, located about 50 kilometres north of Melbourne, is one such place.</p>\n\n<p>I was particularly interested to visit the nearby Wandong Regional Park. Having tried and failed to find any reasonable level of information on the internet (including <a href=\"http://parkweb.vic.gov.au/explore/parks/wandong-r.p.\">ParkWeb</a>), I was curious to have a good look around.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"wandong-railway-station\">Wandong Railway Station</h2>\n\n<p>Wandong Station is a fairly standard country railway station. The pedestrian accessibility needs some work, but I suppose that you could say that about most stations in Victoria.</p>\n\n<p>On my way to the road leading into Wandong Regional Park, I inadvertedly stumbled across the pedestrian footbridge <a href=\"https://wongm.com/2016/10/box-hills-754000-footbridge-across-tracks/\">built a few years ago</a>. It seems to have aged quite well – there was no visible vandalism or deterioration – and it provides a great vantage point for gunzels over the two broad gauge and single standard gauge tracks.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36998953334/in/album-72157661503140208/\" title=\"Wandong footbridge across railway tracks\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4446/36998953334_0fd8db6deb.jpg\" alt=\"Wandong footbridge across railway tracks\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/37450751600/in/album-72157661503140208/\" title=\"V/Line sprinter, Wandong\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4485/37450751600_771267d683.jpg\" alt=\"V/Line sprinter, Wandong\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"wandong-regional-park\">Wandong Regional Park</h2>\n\n<p>This Park’s internet obscurity seems replicated in real life. There is no directional signage to the park approaching from Wandong, nor are there any signs to indicate that you have even entered the area. The only indicators are signs asking trail bike riders to be quiet (not even sure how that’s possible) and a 10km/h shared zone sign on Dry Creek Road.</p>\n\n<p>The scenery here is quite different to most other places in regional Victoria that I have visited. The main difference is the type of vegetation. This entire area was devestated in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday_bushfires\">2009 Black Saturday bushfires</a> and there is still plenty of evidence showing the damage. Wandong and Heathcote Junction were <a href=\"http://www.wandong.vic.au/history/photo-gallery-black-saturday-bushfires/\">severely affected</a> and only saved from being wiped out completely <a href=\"http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/disaster/fire/display/103086-wandong-bushfire-memorial-park-\">by a wind change</a>. Burned out trees jut out over the newly-grown bushland and small eucalyptus saplings are scattered everywhere. It is pretty amazing to see how quickly the bush can recover from such utter devestation in just seven and a half years.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/37660021986/in/album-72157661503140208/\" title=\"Dry Creek Road, Wandong State Forest\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4456/37660021986_0fddefc936.jpg\" alt=\"Dry Creek Road, Wandong State Forest\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>One of the other notable features of this area is the amount of birdlife. From the sights and sounds along the entire walk, there are more birds here than I have seen before in a similar setting. Everywhere you look there is some sort of bird activity.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/37038034603/in/album-72157661503140208/\" title=\"Brown thornbill, Wandong State Forest\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4514/37038034603_5b361363c8.jpg\" alt=\"Brown thornbill, Wandong State Forest\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/37659706576/in/album-72157661503140208/\" title=\"Sacred kingfisher, Wandong Regional Park\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4496/37659706576_98a4da8b98.jpg\" alt=\"Sacred kingfisher, Wandong Regional Park\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>There was also a lot of evidence of other wildlife as well. Apparently there are koalas in the hills but I unfortunately didn’t spot any. There was some roadkill by the side of the track with tyre marks over them (presumably killed by some clueless moron in a 4WD going well over the 10km/h limit) including a large wombat and a wallaby. I did, however, see a few snakes, including this tiger snake sunbaking on a rock in a gas pipeline reserve.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36998760954/in/album-72157661503140208/\" title=\"Tiger snake, Wandong State Forest\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4466/36998760954_47eaa0d78a.jpg\" alt=\"Tiger snake, Wandong State Forest\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Every so often I would hear trail bikes roaring along small tracks through the forest and distant sounds of shotguns. As it is a state and not a national park, these activities are generally permitted.</p>\n\n<p>I followed Dry Creek Road all the way to its intersection with North Mountain Road at the top of a ridge. I was planning to walk onwards to Red Hill or another peak, but given that the plateau seemed more or less the same height, I don’t think that I would have had much of a view.</p>\n\n<p>The other reason that I didn’t continue further into the bushland was that the shotguns that I could hear in the distance earlier sounded much closer. According to the only detailed map of the area that I could find, deer hunting is allowed in areas of Mount Disappointment State Forest on the other side of North Mountain Road. I really wasn’t that keen to try walking through an area filled with fleeing wildlife and people firing guns, so I turned south and started walking down North Mountain Road towards Heathcote Junction.</p>\n\n<p>As usual, there were no facilities for pedestrians, but there was little traffic so I was able to walk on the road reasonably safely. My route back towards Wandong was a little more rushed as I didn’t want to miss the hourly train from Heathcote Junction. Nevertheless, I had time to stop and see some of the terrific views.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/37037947363/in/album-72157661503140208/\" title=\"View towards Wallan from South Mountain Road, Clonbinane\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4473/37037947363_1d9efecbda.jpg\" alt=\"View towards Wallan from South Mountain Road, Clonbinane\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"heathcote-junction\">Heathcote Junction</h2>\n\n<p>Heathcote Junction is an interesting station. It no longer forms part of any railway junction; the branch lines that it serviced having closed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathcote_Junction_railway_station\">many years ago</a>. The most curious feature is that the platform cannot accommodate more than two of the N type carriages that operate along this line. In order to disembark here, an announcement in the train asks passengers to move to the two rear carriages. “And as always, make sure that there is a platform before stepping off the train”.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/37451024850/in/album-72157661503140208/\" title=\"Heathcote Junction Railway Station\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4458/37451024850_042fe0d5c7.jpg\" alt=\"Heathcote Junction Railway Station\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>This was a nice walk through more-or-less deserted bushland only 50 kilometres from Melbourne’s CBD. It is not the most visually interesting place to visit, but you could easily spend half a day having a good look around. There are absolutely no amenities (not even benches) and the network of paths can be confusing at times. As such, the area could use some investment and publicity to encourage more people to visit.</p>\n\n<p>There is a <a href=\"http://www.wandong.vic.au/groups-clubs/wandong-to-heathcote-rail-trail/\">campaign</a> to develop a new network of rail trails that would eventually connect to Craigieburn which seems like a good idea. Promoting and improving Wandong Regional Park would seem a logical extension of this project.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2017/10/15/walking-in-wandong-regional-park","relative_path":"_posts/2017-10-16-walking-in-wandong-regional-park.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Travel"],"layout":"post","id":1704,"title":"Food in the Netherlands","date":"2017-11-02 16:00:47 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=1704","tags":["2017","Netherlands","Rotterdam"],"slug":"food-in-the-netherlands","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p><em>Note: this post was originally written in July during my recent trip to Europe.</em></p>\n","content":"<p><em>Note: this post was originally written in July during my recent trip to Europe.</em></p>\n\n<p>I must admit, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect from a culinary perspective in the Netherlands. My knowledge of Dutch cuisine was very scant; basically limited to pancakes, baked potatoes and bitterballen. Needless to say that the actual situation is much more diverse and delicious.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"markets\">Markets</h3>\n\n<p>On my first proper walk and ride around Rotterdam on Saturday, I found no less than three outdoor markets without really trying. I cheated a little bit on the first one as I had looked it up beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>This was the <a href=\"https://en.rotterdam.info/agenda/rotterdam-harvest-market/\">Rotterdam Harvest Market</a> where local farmers and shopkeepers bring their wares – open every fortnight in a large plaza not far from the city centre. It looked pretty small from a distance, but it had a great variety of food from Argentinian hamburgers to fresh fruit and vegetables.</p>\n\n<p>I bought a small bread puff with chicken and assorted legumes inside as well as a cous cous salad from a stall selling Indian food. Both were delicious and it was very pleasant sitting among the market people watching and enjoying the scenery.</p>\n\n<p>I did not spend as much time in the other two markets that I came across by accident. The first was the Markt Afrikaanderplein which mainly sells Surinamese food and supplies. It was very busy and had caused the first traffic congestion in a side street that I have seen so far at a four-way intersection with pedestrian crossings (<em>a la</em> South Melbourne).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35124731404/\" title=\"Markt Afrikaanderplein, Rotterdam\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4327/35124731404_cb7bb6a332.jpg\" alt=\"Markt Afrikaanderplein, Rotterdam\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The other market was partly outdoors but also inside the Markthal building near the waterfront of Rotterdam. It is one of the most amazing buildings you will probably ever see. It is shaped in an arch creating a huge void underneath. This houses the market with grocers, restaurants and many other types of shops in a relatively busy environment. Around the archway are apartments with little windows for its residents to see inside and out.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35124760794/in/photolist-VyvDr2-WAnzog-WAnAZH-VvRzE3-WcHo7f-WAnBVa-WAnD8F\" title=\"Markthal interior, Rotterdam\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4304/35124760794_ef80d63407.jpg\" alt=\"Markthal interior, Rotterdam\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>This was combined with a large outdoor market in the pedestrian malls around the building. These were mainly selling clothes as well as food and other products.</p>\n\n<p>As an interesting side note, the Dutch word for ‘market’, <em>markt</em>, changes to <em>market</em> when pluralised.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fresh-produce-and-dairy\">Fresh produce and dairy</h3>\n\n<p>I must admit that I was surprised to find that fruit and vegetables here are very nice. It is a little-known fact that the Netherlands is the third largest exporter of food in the world, thanks to careful planning and organisation of food-growing regions around the country. These are specifically located near sea and airports for easy transport and contain highly concentrated aquaculture, agriculture and greenhouses.</p>\n\n<p>The milk, butter and cheese is also particularly good. Even the cheap butter that I bought in a small tub from the local Aldi was creamy and tasty. The milk is also great, but perhaps not quite as good as that from the Australian countryside.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"variety\">Variety</h3>\n\n<p>The mix of cultures is somewhat different to what you would find in Melbourne. There is a lot more evidence of influence from Turkey, Suriname and Nigeria and less influence from China and Malaysia.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35832258211/\" title=\"Lunch bought at Rotterdam Harvest Market\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4294/35832258211_91cc9a8158.jpg\" alt=\"Lunch bought at Rotterdam Harvest Market\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>This means that you can find a lot of different food that is not as easily found in Melbourne.

It has been a great resource for me here in the Netherlands, although I am not sure that I would use it in Melbourne on account of the single gear.</p>\n\n<p>I planned my route using the intersection numbers on the famous <a href=\"http://fietsroutenetwerk.nl/\"><em>fietsroutenetwerk</em> </a>(bicycle network). It works by numbering each intersection along designated bicycle routes. You work out your origin and destination, find the intersections numbers and write them down. Then you simply follow the signs at each intersection directing you to numbers.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36170163192/in/album-72157684460111701/\" title=\"Fietsroutenetwerk for south-east Rotterdam\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4388/36170163192_cc29d1575b.jpg\" alt=\"Fietsroutenetwerk for south-east Rotterdam\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>It’s a very cool system that makes wayfinding over medium and long distances much easier – and you don’t even need a map!</p>\n\n<p>I set out across the Erasmus Bridge towards the port area. My route took me through some very interesting and varied urban form, from inner city housing to industrial port areas.</p>\n\n<p>After getting a little lost in the beautiful forests and parks of Pendrecht, I cut through to follow the railway line to Waalhaven; one of Rotterdam’s many port areas. Even here, the bike infrastructure did not deteriorate and was of high quality all the way through these non-residential sections.</p>\n\n<p>One interesting thing to note here was that half of a motorway on-ramp had been converted into a segregated bicycle path that ran between a railway line and the A15 motorway. To me, this was a powerful statement about the priorities placed on different transport modes. The transport authorities were willing to recognise the benefits of such a move and reallocated street space to bicycles. Imagine something like this being proposed in Melbourne – motorists would have a fit.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35530190983/in/album-72157684460111701/\" title=\"Motorway off-ramp converted into bicycle path, Rotterdam\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4321/35530190983_bf6f23fe11.jpg\" alt=\"Motorway off-ramp converted into bicycle path, Rotterdam\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I picked the rainiest day of the week to travel. While riding alongside the A15, it started pouring with rain. This was a bad coincidence as this long grassy section had absolutely no shelter. I had no choice but to keep riding.</p>\n\n<p>My original plan was to continue all the way to Hoogvliet but I decided to cut my losses and not risk getting drenched again. I made a random turn down at the first opportunity to cross the motorway and head south.</p>\n\n<p>After getting help from a friendly local man (also on a bike), I found the winding road leading to Rhoon.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-town-of-rhoon\">The town of Rhoon</h2>\n\n<p>The best way to describe my impressions of Rhoon is to simply say that it is the picture-perfect place that I had pictured in my mind as the typical Western European country village. Having been established in 1199, it is unimaginably old by modern Australian standards.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36170147872/in/album-72157684460111701/\" title=\"Dutch country houses near Rhoon\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4440/36170147872_c113ffe2c3.jpg\" alt=\"Dutch country houses near Rhoon\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Every single building is perfectly proportioned and fits in nicely with its surroundings – even the more recent constructions.</p>\n\n<p>The central area is a little more compact but has the sort of narrow laneways that you often associate with such small village terrace houses. With the historic buildings, peaceful environment and cobbled surfaces you almost expect some 12th century farmer to come around the corner carrying carrots or potatoes.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35942122910/in/album-72157684460111701/\" title=\"Centre of Rhoon\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4320/35942122910_44046815a2.jpg\" alt=\"Centre of Rhoon\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The Sint Willibrorduskerk Church is located near the centre of the village. It is surrounded by greenery and is very picturesque. A <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35530175243/in/album-72157684460111701/\">small memorial</a> to the people from the Rhoon who died during the Second World War and subsequent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution\">Indonesian War of Independence</a> entrance to the graveyard.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"metro-from-rhoon-to-rotterdam\">Metro from Rhoon to Rotterdam</h2>\n\n<p>I left my OBike at the Metro station (the only one for many kilometres around). As with every public transport stop that I have seen in the Netherlands, it was very well-designed. Entrances were located on both sides of the tracks, there was ample shelter and accurate real-time information was displayed in many areas. Even though it was a Sunday, trains were still operating to 20 minute frequencies in a town that isn’t even in Rotterdam.</p>\n\n<p>For an Australian, it is a little difficult to understand how Western Europe differentiates between the various modes of rail transport. In the Netherlands, there are trams, heavy rail and Metro. To better conceptualise it, it is best to think of heavy rail as V/Line (intercity) and Metro as Melbourne’s suburban rail network (intracity). This is the case even though the vehicles used on the Metro here would probably be classified as light rail vehicles in Australia.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35502982404/in/album-72157684460111701/\" title=\"RET Metro vehicle (outbound) at Rhoon Metro Station\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4391/35502982404_e52ef911e6.jpg\" alt=\"RET Metro vehicle (outbound) at Rhoon Metro Station\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>As for the trip itself, the Metro was clean, punctual and convenient. It dropped me off right in the middle of Rotterdam and it only cost about €1:80. The screens and audio announcements made it easy to know where to get off the train.</p>\n\n<p>All up, a very pleasant experience. As with Melbourne, I highly recommend getting out of the city centre and visiting suburbs and outskirts of cities. It gives you a variety of urban forms and a taste of what living in the city is really like for the majority of the population. Plus, you can find hidden gems like Rhoon by accident!</p>\n","url":"/blog/2017/11/13/my-trip-to-rhoon","relative_path":"_posts/2017-11-14-my-trip-to-rhoon.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Travel"],"layout":"post","id":1732,"title":"Why Rotterdam is my favourite Dutch city","date":"2017-12-05 16:36:54 -0600","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=1732","tags":["2017","Netherlands","Rotterdam"],"slug":"why-rotterdam-is-my-favourite-dutch-city","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p><em>Note: this post was originally written in July during my trip to Europe.</em></p>\n","content":"<p><em>Note: this post was originally written in July during my trip to Europe.</em></p>\n\n<p>I have found that sharing my high opinion of Rotterdam with others elicits a variety of responses ranging from furious agreement to simply fury. On the upside, it does stimulate discussion on the relative drawbacks and merits of Dutch cities which I find quite interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I would still pick Rotterdam as my favourite city in the Netherlands.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"urban-form\">Urban form</h2>\n\n<p>The first and most important reason to me is the city’s urban form. Despite its reputation, Rotterdam is a beautiful city.</p>\n\n<p>I am generally not a big fan of modernist architecture in Australia. I would be hard pressed to come up with more than four or five buildings in the whole country of this style that I would consider attractive or well-designed. As a result, I believed that I did not like modernism. Rotterdam quickly changed my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>The city’s bombing by the Luftwaffe during the German Invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940 left almost the entire central area in ruins. The post-war rebuilding was in the style of the times which resulted in tens of thousands of public and private modernist constructions. This combines with the older styles of architecture in other areas that make the buildings both interesting and aesthetically pleasing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35955428411/in/album-72157683503223274/\" title=\"Housing in Kleinpolder, Rotterdam\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4320/35955428411_bb29c42232.jpg\" alt=\"Housing in Kleinpolder, Rotterdam\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>It is not just the style of architecture that attracts me to Rotterdam’s urban form. It is also the scale and size of the city. Most residential or mixed-use buildings are between three and five storeys in height; the perfect balance between density and the human scale.</p>\n\n<p>To my mind, this attention to the scale of people and the city’s relatively wide streets make Rotterdam feel expansive without being empty. In contrast, Amsterdam and The Hague felt too cramped at times. Perhaps this was due to the large volumes of tourists, but the point still stands.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35091212314/in/album-72157683503223274/\" title=\"Witte de Withstraat, Rotterdam\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4324/35091212314_cee1581875.jpg\" alt=\"Witte de Withstraat, Rotterdam\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport\">Transport</h2>\n\n<p>This point probably relates to all Dutch cities, but Rotterdam more than pulls its weight in relation to the rest of the Netherlands.</p>\n\n<p>As I <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2017/09/11/some-thoughts-on-dutch-transport/\">wrote previously</a>, its near-flawless integration of transport modes makes travelling incredibly easy and convenient. You could write several books on how well the city has done, but highlights include the OV-Fiets bicycle hire service, seamless train-tram transfers at Rotterdam Central Station and general separation of trams and traffic.</p>\n\n<p>The other main point to mention related to transport is, of course, bicycles. Despite being told beforehand that it was one of the least bicycle-friendly cities in the Netherlands, in my relatively short trips to several Dutch cities I found Rotterdam to be the most pleasant city in which to ride.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35502969684/in/album-72157683503223274/\" title=\"Bicycles and tram in central Rotterdam\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4417/35502969684_cb87c91800.jpg\" alt=\"Bicycles and tram in central Rotterdam\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Despite Amsterdam’s reputation as a cycling city, Rotterdam has better bicycle infrastructure. This is mainly through no fault of the former city as they have much narrower streets and more challenging street layouts with which to contend. There are many more separated bicycle paths and lanes in Rotterdam rather than the significantly less useful on-road paint that was far more prevalent in Amsterdam.</p>\n\n<p>Over my two-and-a-half week trip, every major intersection that cycled through in Rotterdam had separated bicycle treatments regardless of whether there was a separated path along the rest of the street or not. This is a lesson that other cities would do well to heed. It really makes a huge difference to actual and perceived safety in so many ways.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35542520820/in/album-72157674616583583/\" title=\"Typical bicycle crossing at intersection, Rotterdam\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4262/35542520820_4afd86743e_n.jpg\" alt=\"Typical bicycle crossing at intersection, Rotterdam\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"general-pleasantness\">General pleasantness</h2>\n\n<p>Put simply, Rotterdam is a really nice city. Again, this could easily apply to any other place in the country, but I found Rotterdam to be the most pleasant.</p>\n\n<p>It is hard to articulate why this is exactly the case. It is more of a feeling than any sort of objective metric. But wherever I went throughout the city, it just felt like a beautiful, happy and pleasant place.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36048631606/in/album-72157683503223274/\" title=\"Urban happiness next to Markthal, Rotterdam\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4291/36048631606_c43ef0c93d.jpg\" alt=\"Urban happiness next to Markthal, Rotterdam\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>On one occasion, I unwittingly found myself in an area of public housing which is one of the least safe parts of the city, according to Dutch people who heard this story. This was not apparent to me at the time but while I was there, it too felt like a pleasant place. People were weeding their community garden plots, neighbours were holding outdoor dinner parties in the local park and children played in the street (one group asked to borrow my bike).</p>\n\n<p>Everything about the area – the buildings, atmosphere and people – felt calm and content. This was the case no matter where I went (with the notable exception of parts of West-Kruiskade). Even the Port of Rotterdam felt surprisingly agreeable.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35248620054/in/album-72157683503223274/\" title=\"Vroesenpark, Rotterdam\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4297/35248620054_6b76cc511c.jpg\" alt=\"Vroesenpark, Rotterdam\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>It is hard to fault Rotterdam for anything much. Admittedly I spent more time here than in any other part of the Netherlands, but from my perspective it would take a lot to beat.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2017/12/05/why-rotterdam-is-my-favourite-dutch-city","relative_path":"_posts/2017-12-06-why-rotterdam-is-my-favourite-dutch-city.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Travel"],"layout":"post","id":1759,"title":"Two days in the Lake District","date":"2017-12-20 18:20:25 -0600","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=1759","tags":["2017","Europe 2017","Manchester","Oxenholme","Train","United Kingdom","Windermere"],"slug":"two-days-in-the-lake-district","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p><em>Note: this post was written in August 2017 during my trip to Europe.</em></p>\n","content":"<p><em>Note: this post was written in August 2017 during my trip to Europe.</em></p>\n\n<p>That a European can fly for 55 minutes and be at the end of a totally different country is still something that amazes me. The same amount of time in Australia would barely get you between two major cities.</p>\n\n<p>Today I bid the Netherlands goodbye and began the second leg of my journey to the United Kingdom. My first stop was Windermere in the heart of the Lake District.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"arrival-in-manchester\">Arrival in Manchester</h2>\n\n<p>The plan was to fly from Amsterdam-Schiphol to Manchester and catch the train to Windermere. This involved a change at Oxenholme.</p>\n\n<p>My first experience of the UK was not a very good one. Immigration control proceeded slowly and with little guidance. I only noticed about 10 minutes into the wait that there was a separate exit if you wanted to transfer between flights.</p>\n\n<p>As this took longer than I expected, I rushed to find the ambitiously-named Manchester Airport Railway Station. It was located a good 10 minute walk away from my terminal. The route is rather bizarre and requires using two lifts and several buildings to access the public transport interchange. Fortunately, the route is well-signed so I did not get lost, but there was a large queue waiting for the first lift.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"manchester-to-windermere-by-train\">Manchester to Windermere by train</h2>\n\n<p>The rail journey from Manchester Airport to Windermere involves two trains. The first operates from Manchester Airport to Oxenholme with a connecting train from there to Windermere.</p>\n\n<p>Boarding the train was more confusing than was necessary. Almost all of the seats had little reservation cards displayed. As I had no reserved seat, it was unclear to me where I was supposed to sit. I wasn’t the only one, with quite a few other recently-arrived and confused tourists roaming the carriages. I opted to sit in the disability-priority row as this did not have a reservation sign and gamble that I would not have to give up my seat. It would have been nice to have been told the seating arrangements when I purchased my ticket, on the ticket itself or somewhere on the train.</p>\n\n<p>The train was relatively empty from the airport but filled up very quickly once we reached Manchester – Piccadilly. My very superficial and fleeting impressions of Manchester from the railway viaduct were not very favourable. Many of the buildings seemed unkept and unused. The suburbs seemed to be rows of similar houses in narrow and winding residential streets. However, this was just 10-15 minutes of looking out of a train window, so I will reserve final judgement on Manchester until I get a chance to have a look properly.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36438047286/in/album-72157684905824283/\" title=\"Passing through Manchester\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4407/36438047286_4ac6ba2625.jpg\" alt=\"Passing through Manchester\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The rest of the train journey was uneventful. As no disabled or elderly people boarded in my carriage, I had no need to give up the seat. There was a food and drink trolley service on the train which I think is a rather nice touch.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, due to a Virgin train at Oxenholme experiencing “technical difficulties”, my train was delayed by a few minutes. This meant that everyone missed the connecting train to Windermere, which operates to 40 minute frequencies on weekdays. If the train had been held by just two minutes or so, everyone would have been able to cross the platform and board.</p>\n\n<p>I am not very familiar with the way in which Britain’s regional railway system operates, but I do know that it is operated by several private companies. In cases like the one I just described, an integrated system would have held the connecting train for a few minutes. This happens all the time with V/Line. When a train is late, connecting V/Line coaches will be held until the train arrives. Having them both within the same single operator ensures that proper communication and coordination occurs.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36484089705/in/album-72157684905824283/\" title=\"Northern train to Windermere arrives at Oxenholme Station\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4395/36484089705_10ac29d015.jpg\" alt=\"Northern train to Windermere arrives at Oxenholme Station\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>After a stroll around Oxenholme Railway Station, the two-carriage diesel train arrived (<em>a la</em> Stony Point Line). It was quite crowded as passengers from our train as well as the following service were travelling together. The train felt quite dated and a little dirty, but it did get me to Windermere.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"first-day\">First day</h2>\n\n<p>Arriving at Windermere Station was quite a relief. I was able to quickly find my accommodation with the aid of my offline OpenStreetMap app (a quick plug for the <a href=\"https://maps.me\">Maps.me app</a> which has been incredibly helpful).</p>\n\n<p>As I had lost 45 minutes of my day to the train delay, I quickly dropped off my bags and set out to find some walks. The Lake District is World Heritage-listed for its natural beauty and it was for this reason that I wanted to visit; I have little interest in the never-ending Beatrix Potter paraphernalia around the town.</p>\n\n<p>I had marked a few summits on Maps.me and set out to climb them. The first that I walked to was Orrest Head to the north of Windermere.</p>\n\n<p>The walk begins next to a busy road but the path quickly leads you away and into a small but magical forest. Here it is easy to see why this area has been afforded the highest UNESCO heritage commendation possible. The old stone walls lead the path through rows of English elms and other trees up into the less vegetated highlands of the hill. The main thing that first strikes you is the colour – everything is bathed in a lush darkish green. It was hard to do this scene justice with my iPhone camera but I hope that I didn’t do too badly.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36315620882/in/album-72157684905824283/\" title=\"View from Orrest Head, Windermere\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4432/36315620882_b9b6d80256.jpg\" alt=\"View from Orrest Head, Windermere\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>There are several nice places to stop on the way up to the summit for wide views across to the lake but the peak is the view for which you should hold out. It is a 360-degree view from the lake across to rolling valleys and barren hilltops awash in sunlight. You can see for long distances in all directions which made it a very pleasant place and well worth the climb.</p>\n\n<p>On the way back down, I came across my first squirrel – I think it will have to be added to my cutest animal list! This one ran down a tree trunk and sat on top of a wooden log for a while before foraging in the undergrowth for food. Its movement reminded me a little of a kangaroo or wallaby due to its long strides. I also saw some deer in another part of the forest; not wildlife that you generally find in Melbourne.</p>\n\n<p>I walked back through the town centre and through the residential areas of Windermere to find my next climb to School Knott. The houses here were quite different to those in the Netherlands. Mostly constructed of slate or other stone, they were mostly two storeys high with a few single and triple-storey buildings thrown in. Two or three would be directly next to each other and share a wall.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36484084095/in/album-72157684905824283/\" title=\"Fairfield Road, Windermere\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4398/36484084095_8534d458f9.jpg\" alt=\"Fairfield Road, Windermere\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Accessing School Knott was a little more difficult than Orrest Head. The path leading to the National Trust land was not paved and half of it seemed to serve as a shallow creekbed. It had rained quite extensively earlier in the day so some parts were more or less underwater. This area also served as sheep grazing land, something that seems fairly common with these National Trust public rights of way.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36484079845/in/album-72157684905824283/\" title=\"Sheep on School Knott, Windermere\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4417/36484079845_b88d006e64.jpg\" alt=\"Sheep on School Knott, Windermere\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>School Knott was a very different hill in scenery and topography. It was quite barren with a little low vegetation but almost no trees whatsoever. It looked like a scene from a sub-Antarctic island or Lord of the Rings. This seemed a well-preserved area. The National Trust has erected signs telling people to ‘keep to the path’, which seemed very odd when quite often there was no visible path to follow.</p>\n\n<p>The walk through mud and sheep poo was well worth it. The views across to the lake and the hills were even better than from Orrest Head as this peak is about 40 metres higher and not obstructed by trees. It was far quieter too – I saw only two other people here on my way back down.</p>\n\n<p>I walked back into town and had dinner at a local fish and chip shop. Haddock with chips and mushy peas was £7:20 – very reasonable given the amount of food that I was given. Despite not having had much lunch, I couldn’t finish this meal. It was also my first time eating haddock. It was good but the cod that I had in Schivenengen in the Netherlands was more flavoursome.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36484079295/in/album-72157684905824283/\" title=\"Haddock and chips with mushy peas, Windermere\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4365/36484079295_53d7b3512b.jpg\" alt=\"Haddock and chips with mushy peas, Windermere\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>After a good rest, a pleasant walk down to the Lake and my first-ever full English breakfast the next day (which was delicious), I caught my train to Oxford. I could have easily spent a few more days in the area to do some of the longer walks, but in any case I lacked most of the appropriate equipment. I would definitely like to come back and see more of the area one day.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2017/12/20/two-days-in-the-lake-district","relative_path":"_posts/2017-12-21-two-days-in-the-lake-district.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Cycling"],"layout":"post","id":1761,"title":"Bicycle trip: Gippsland Plains Rail Trail","date":"2017-12-24 04:52:15 -0600","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=1761","slug":"bicycle-trip-gippsland-plains-rail-trail","ext":".md","tags":[],"excerpt":"<p>One of the more recent additions to the extensive off-road trail network in Victoria is the <a href=\"http://www.gippslandplainsrailtrail.com.au/\">Gippsland Plains Rail Trail</a>.

It is a nice little station with a wooden building and, bizarrely, a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/39247763611/in/datetaken/\">vacant myki reader totem</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/25381068438/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Stratford Railway Station\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4689/25381068438_fc9aab56b8.jpg\" alt=\"Stratford Railway Station\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The first part of the trail does not extend to the railway station. This means a short ride along the Princes Highway (not recommended) or walking bikes along the footpath of Stratford’s main street. Far from the worst start to an off-road trail, but it could definitely be better.</p>\n\n<p>The path here, as for the vast majority of the trail, is made of compacted fine gravel. It is actually a very good surface on which to ride. It was smooth in most places and relatively free of water damage. The main issue with the path was an apparent lack of mowing. I know it is early summer and the strange weather has resulted in grass growing faster than the speed of light, but throughout this section in particular there were significant stretches of path with stinging nettles and other scrub growing near or over the path.</p>\n\n<p>Our first stop was at the point where the Briagolong Branch Line met with the old Gippsland Plains Line. The embankment is still there and somebody had thoughtfully provided a bench and information sign with a history of the area. I am sure it was very interesting, but we could not access the board as it was located in the middle of some high grass (not the best place to go fumbling around in an Australian summer lest you find a new snake friend).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/27472399189/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Well-located information sign and bench\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4588/27472399189_61f10baaac.jpg\" alt=\"Well-located information sign and bench\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Next stop was the main town along the trail itself. Maffra is a pleasant and reasonably large settlement with a lively main street and shopping precinct. The old court house is a particularly nice building. Unfortunately, the trail does not follow the railway here, forcing users to either ride along service roads or walk along the footpath again.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/39219417872/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Old Maffra Courthouse\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4593/39219417872_32883c3132_n.jpg\" alt=\"Old Maffra Courthouse\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>One of the best things about this trail is all of the old railway infrastructure that remains. While some of the bridges were too dilapidated to restore when the rail trail was being built, many have been retained and repurposed. Plenty of platforms, bridge pylons and other remnants still dot the path’s route. Our lunch stop at the site of the former Tinamba Station is one such place. Parts of the platform, wood foundations and a level crossing gate are still visible.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/24385440907/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Old level crossing gate at Trafalgar-Tinamba Road\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4733/24385440907_80dfff46de.jpg\" alt=\"Old level crossing gate at Trafalgar-Tinamba Road\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>From Tinamba onwards, there were a lot of new gates located at road crossings. While it is commendable that the designers of the path are trying to stop motor vehicles and other prohibited users from accessing the path. their design could be significantly improved. Each gate is so narrow and at such odd angles that they require dismounting. When road crossings are as frequent as on the Gippsland Plains Rail Trail, it gets rather tiresome very quickly.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"heyfield--cowwarr\">Heyfield – Cowwarr</h2>\n\n<p>Heyfield is another small town with some conveniences for nearby residents and tourists. Here the path leaves the original route of the railway line for a small section. The maps for the path’s route at this location are incorrect, directing us down a narrow dirt path that ends after 20 metres (I have since corrected OpenStreetMap). The actual trail is slightly further north but impossible to access without backtracking. Although the trail’s overall wayfinding was among the best and contiguous that I have seen for any off-road trail, this is one location where it needs improvement.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/38540460534/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Incorrectly mapped path\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4729/38540460534_e09b62a380_n.jpg\" alt=\"Incorrectly mapped path\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The one good thing about the unnecessary hill climb, as always, was the view from the top. Although it was partially obstructed by buildings and trees, you could still see across the open fields south of Heyfield.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/24385920837/in/datetaken/\" title=\"View across houses in Heyfield\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4736/24385920837_5ffeddb13e_n.jpg\" alt=\"View across houses in Heyfield\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>After Heyfield, the path enters some remnant bushland. It was nice to be in shade but also made lots of bark across the path look like a snake. Lots of bell ringing and calling out was our way of trying to distinguish still from moving sticks. We did end up almost running over a snake later on that looked like bark from a distance so we were not being too paranoid.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/38371756215/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Abandoned Dawson Railway Station, Heyfield\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4727/38371756215_e4b91b6847.jpg\" alt=\"Abandoned Dawson Railway Station, Heyfield\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>At the abandoned Dawson Railway Station, there is a five kilometre gap in the path on account of an impassable bridge. This is an on-road section of the trail along some relatively quiet country roads. However, I would not take a family or inexperienced riders along this part. There are no sealed shoulders, a high speed limit and some blind corners/crests. But to their credit, every single driver that passed gave us well above a metre of room and were very courteous – much better than many Melbourne drivers!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/39219864732/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Country road, Cowwarr\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4598/39219864732_711aff1389.jpg\" alt=\"Country road, Cowwarr\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>We rejoined the path high on an embankment. This treated us to some beautiful views across lush farmland with the Great Dividing Range rising in the distance. At the town of Cowwarr, the station site has been done up recently and is quite interesting. An old wagon has been placed near the road crossing with lots of railway remnants scattered around the area.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/27472692839/in/datetaken/\" title=\"GY railway wagon, Cowwarr\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4683/27472692839_14f68339c8.jpg\" alt=\"GY railway wagon, Cowwarr\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cowwarr--traralgon\">Cowwarr – Traralgon</h2>\n\n<p>This section includes a number of interesting bridges crossing low-lying areas, dams and creeks. They are all original rail bridges that have been restored and modified to accommodate trail users. They offer very nice views across the landscape in addition to preserving historic rail infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>The trail between Toongabbie and Glengarry was uneventful other than crossing more railway viaducts and bridges. There are definitely more along this trail than any other that I have ridden so far.</p>\n\n<p>Glengarry has the only remaining station building along the former railway. It seems to have been converted into some sort of shop or community centre and has been well-maintained. The platform is in good condition and, as with the other stations, lots of remnants scattered around. This includes an old crane that has been placed in the middle of the park and the only drink tap that we could find along the entire trail.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/38371586835/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Abandoned Glengarry Railway Station\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4590/38371586835_f6a58ff504.jpg\" alt=\"Abandoned Glengarry Railway Station\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The trail continues from Glengarry towards Traralgon. Unfortunately, the path comes to an abrupt end on the very edge of the town into a drain. Given that the majority of the rail reservation still exists, I can’t see a reason why it could not continue all the way to Traralgon Railway Station.</p>\n\n<p>In its current state, trail users must go on-road for this last section. OpenStreetMap and the official trail map have the route going straight down the main road into the centre of Traralgon. To me that is a terrible idea, especially for families or inexperienced riders. This is because of the lack of any bike facilities, high traffic volumes and 60-80 km/h speed limits. We opted for a slightly less direct but much safer route through the suburbs of the town. This also gave us an opportunity to have a quick look around these areas.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/38371576605/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Suburbs of Traralgon\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4589/38371576605_dc4c77f921.jpg\" alt=\"Suburbs of Traralgon\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>We had about 30 minutes before the hourly train left Traralgon so we took our time. As subdivisions go, they were not dissimilar to any that you would find in the outer suburbs of Melbourne. Some had no footpaths, but I suppose that is to be expected from developments in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/39247935201/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Traralgon Railway Station sign\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4633/39247935201_fc5f32141f.jpg\" alt=\"Traralgon Railway Station sign\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>Being two days before Christmas, we saw only three other people using the trail, all south of Cowwarr. However, this trail has a lot of potential and will hopefully become more popular as word gets around. It has a significant advantage over many other trails with V/Line connections at both ends and lots of railway remnants to keep any gunzels interested.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that being a relatively new trail, some facilities along the way are quite sparse. For example, the only public drink tap is located in Glengarry. However, it is well-equipped for other amenities as there are quite a few toilets along the way and ample seating opportunities. Obviously be aware of snakes and make sure that you take aeroguard. Flies seem to particularly like the section between Maffra and Cowwarr.</p>\n\n<p>I would also recommend riding the trail from Stratford to Traralgon and not the other way around. Trains are much more frequent from Traralgon (hourly on the Saturday when we visited) rather than the three per day that run to Stratford. This means far less chance that you will have to rush to not miss your train, which is never a good way to end a ride.</p>\n\n<p>This being the last post of the year (probably), hope you have a merry Christmas and great new year!</p>\n","url":"/blog/2017/12/24/bicycle-trip-gippsland-plains-rail-trail","relative_path":"_posts/2017-12-24-bicycle-trip-gippsland-plains-rail-trail.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Travel"],"layout":"post","id":1829,"title":"Parma: an overlooked Italian city","date":"2018-02-25 04:14:18 -0600","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=1829","tags":["2017","Europe 2017","Italy","Parma"],"slug":"parma-an-overlooked-italian-city","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p><em>Note: this post was written in August 2017 during my trip to Europe.</em></p>\n","content":"<p><em>Note: this post was written in August 2017 during my trip to Europe.</em></p>\n\n<p>Whenever I mentioned to people that I was visiting Parma, I was most often met with puzzlement and questions asking why I would go there. My answer was always the same: for the food. But on my arrival in Parma, I was pleasantly surprised at the visual attractiveness of the city as well.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"city-centre\">City centre</h2>\n\n<p>My first walk into Parma’s centre was an unplanned and purely exploratory exercise. I had not done much research on the architecture of Parma as my main reason to travel here was to sample some of the local regional cuisine, which includes some of my favourite ingredients and dishes (e.g. parma ham and risotto).</p>\n\n<p>I crossed one of the main bridges over the bone-dry River Parma and right in front of me was the towering Palazzo della Pilotta. This sight of this imposing yet beautiful building took my breath away, which is not something that happens very often.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36007729243/in/album-72157685608092414/\" title=\"Palazzo della Pilotta, Parma\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4409/36007729243_fac3aa37e5.jpg\" alt=\"Palazzo della Pilotta, Parma\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>It is difficult to do the place justice with an iPhone camera, but this central area is beautiful. The square that surrounds the Palazzo and its adjacent buildings is large enough to fit into the scale of the 6-7 storey buildings but small enough to cross in a reasonable amount of time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36007728773/in/album-72157685608092414/\" title=\"Palazzo della Pilotta, Parma\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4365/36007728773_a378bc346e.jpg\" alt=\"Palazzo della Pilotta, Parma\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Parma is not a large city – it only has a population of around 190,000. But because of its compact nature, the central area still bustles with activity. There were hardly any non-Italian tourists around and even these regional visitors were small in number. This gave Parma an authentic feeling that parts of Florence and Rome did not have later in my trip.</p>\n\n<p>There are no tourist traps, no stalls selling fake jewellery and postcards, and certainly no <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.it/20151126/rome-banishes-tourist-scamming-gladiators\">fake gladiators</a> trying to sell overpriced photographs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"museums-and-parks\">Museums and parks</h2>\n\n<p>The Palazzo della Pilotta does much more than look pretty from the outside. It houses a large art collection that is of very high quality. For five euros (discounts apply for youth, students and other concession classes), you gain access to the Palazzo’s various exhibits.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36007716023/in/album-72157685608092414/\" title=\"Portrait of Erasmus\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4416/36007716023_b4b582d13a.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Erasmus\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The National Gallery is exceptionally well-stocked with a wide variety of sculptures, paintings and other artwork from a very large timescale. Pieces range from little-known local artists through to works by Correggio and even Leonardo da Vinci.</p>\n\n<p>Probably the most memorable part of the experience at the Palazzo is the entrance. Once you buy your ticket, you are shown through an archway with little indication that through this doorway lies a massive theatre. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_Farnese\">Teatro Farnese</a> was first constructed in 1618 and extensively reconstructed shortly afterwards. As with the Palazzo itself, the theatre was heavily bombed during World War 2 and rebuilt in 1962 in its plain original 1618 style. It is a strikingly large building and is still used for performances today.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36677430761/in/album-72157685608092414/\" title=\"Teatro Farnese, Parma\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4377/36677430761_f093740d4b.jpg\" alt=\"Teatro Farnese, Parma\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Another surprise in Parma was stumbling upon its main area of green open space, just across the river from the Palazzo della Pilotta. The Parco Ducale is a beautiful and expansive park that is definitely the best one that I have come across in Italy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36677419381/in/album-72157685608092414/\" title=\"Parco Ducale, Parma\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4357/36677419381_60933c83c7.jpg\" alt=\"Parco Ducale, Parma\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>As I was walking down one of its long paths for the first time, I started hearing a male choir singing verses from an opera. Not quite convinced that I wasn’t going crazy and hearing things, I continued walking, only for the singing to get louder. Turns out that there is a cultural centre next to the park where they keep the windows open while rehearsing. It was very relaxing to sit on a shady bench nearby and enjoy the scenery with this beautiful singing in the background.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"food\">Food</h2>\n\n<p>As mentioned at the beginning of this post, food was the main reason for visiting Parma and did not disappoint. I have written a separate post on food in northern Italy that goes into Parma’s food scene in more detail.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"architecture-and-planning\">Architecture and planning</h2>\n\n<p>It is worth mentioning the ‘ordinary’ buildings of Parma in addition to its monuments and grand public buildings.</p>\n\n<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my walks through the inner suburbs of Parma and the city centre. Many of the 3-4 storey buildings are colourful and look very fetching, especially in the low light of sunrise and sunset.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35982304764/in/album-72157685608092414/\" title=\"Laneway, Parma\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4331/35982304764_e8a60e09b5.jpg\" alt=\"Laneway, Parma\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>There are several ‘main streets’ which have had vehicle traffic mostly restricted. This has created long and winding cobbled streets with cafe chairs, street stalls and other diversions that keep these areas vibrant and interesting.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"overall\">Overall</h2>\n\n<p>Parma and Bergamo are the two places in Italy to which I would definitely like to return. Compared to Florence and Rome later in my trip, they were both much more pleasant cities to visit in almost every conceivable measure.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2018/02/25/parma-an-overlooked-italian-city","relative_path":"_posts/2018-02-25-parma-an-overlooked-italian-city.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"post","title":"It is never too late to be what you might have been","date":"2018-04-24 07:01:35 -0500","image":"/images/post-9.jpg","tags":["travel","notes"],"slug":"It-is-never-too-late-to-be-what-you-might-have-been","ext":".markdown","excerpt":"<p>In qua quid est boni praeter summam voluptatem, et eam sempiternam.

It ceased operating in 1993 and until recently formed part of the South Gippsland Tourist Railway which folded in 2016.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"melbourne-to-korumburra\">Melbourne to Korumburra</h2>\n\n<p>V/Line still services the region with regional coaches. The [service to Yarram](https://www.vline.com.au/getattachment/44615b59-182d-456a-a25d-57b25de3d88b/Yarram-Melbourne-(via-Leongatha,-Koo-Wee-Rup-a-(1)) departs Southern Cross Station at 08:50 and runs express to Koo Wee Rup. There it meets another coach running from Dandenong which continues onto Cowes on Phillip Island. It is an interesting service pattern that caters for passengers with different origins and destinations in the region.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/43498345602/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Yarram coach at Korumburra\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/942/43498345602_5d8fccaa83.jpg\" alt=\"Yarram coach at Korumburra\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The coach to Yarram then continues through Lang Lang, Nyora and Loch before arriving in Korrumburra. All up, the trip from Southern Cross takes almost two hours. The scenery along the way is very pleasant, showcasing the lush and green rolling hills dotted with cows and clumps of remnant bushland. Those prone to bus sickness should take note as these lovely hills also make the roads meander quite significantly.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/41736684550/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Rolling hills of Gippsland, Korumburra\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1784/41736684550_30b59ea6a9.jpg\" alt=\"Rolling hills of Gippsland, Korumburra\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"korumburra-and-the-south-gippsland-railway\">Korumburra and the South Gippsland Railway</h2>\n\n<p>The centre of Korumburra contains a good mix of shops. A short walk away from the main street is the disused Korumburra Railway Station. It once served as the former headquarters of the South Gippsland Tourist Railway. All of the track, station buildings and other infrastructure have been left in their place. Apart from some graffiti and vandalism, it all remains more or less intact.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/43497927952/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Looking south-east towards Korumburra Station\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/925/43497927952_4c9cc36a64.jpg\" alt=\"Looking south-east towards Korumburra Station\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"walk-through-korumburra\">Walk through Korumburra</h2>\n\n<p>Of course, there is plenty more to see in the region than just historic rail infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Walking south of the main street takes you into the residential areas of the town. Some parts seem to have been developed more recently than others, as evidenced by the lack of power poles and different building typologies. Almost all of the buildings are single storey with very nice views across the landscape in several directions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/42639961545/in/datetaken/\" title=\"William Street view, Korumburra\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1827/42639961545_85afeced4b.jpg\" alt=\"William Street view, Korumburra\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>We stopped for lunch at one of the two local pubs (the one that looked busier, which is a good way of working these things out) and continued on our way to the north of the railway line to have a look at the caravan park and the parkland around the parking area. The houses on this side looked older and smaller than those on the southern side. Perhaps it had to do with proximity and ease of access to the railway station.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>Korumburra is definitely worth a visit, even if you are not a transport gunzel. There are interesting and scenic areas to visit that we did not have time to see, such as the old coal mine and museum just outside of the town centre.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2018/07/21/day-trip-to-korumburra-railways-old-and-new","relative_path":"_posts/2018-07-21-day-trip-to-korumburra-railways-old-and-new.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport"],"layout":"post","id":1899,"title":"How far can you travel in Melbourne for just $4.30?","date":"2018-08-10 17:00:52 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=1899","tags":["Melbourne","myki","Public transport"],"slug":"how-far-can-you-travel-in-melbourne-for-just-4-30","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>If you travel long distances, Melbourne’s flat rate fare system works very much in your favour.</p>\n","content":"<p>If you travel long distances, Melbourne’s flat rate fare system works very much in your favour.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of whether you travel 800 metres or 40 kilometres, myki will charge you the same amount for a 2 hour zone 1 and 2 fare ($4.30 as of 2018).</p>\n\n<p>I have taken advantage of this before to travel very cheaply to towns beyond Melbourne’s city boundaries such as <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2017/10/16/walking-in-wandong-regional-park/\">Wandong</a> and <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/41134038962/in/album-72157695181691605/\">Warburton.</a></p>\n\n<p>So what is the furthest that you can travel for only $4:30?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"criteria\">Criteria</h2>\n\n<p>Before working this out, we need a couple of ground rules:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Distance measured is ‘as the crow flies’ and not the actual distance taken on a vehicle.

You would need to take a V/Line train from Wandong to Southern Cross Station, a metropolitan train from there to Frankston and finally change to one of the 782 buses that services the weekday off-peak extension to Flinders.</p>\n\n<p>The next top five results that I tested in descending order of distance from furthest to shortest are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Lara to East Warburton – 122.75 kilometres</li>\n  <li>Bacchus Marsh to East Warburton – 116.64 kilometres</li>\n  <li>Wandong to Stony Point – 114.53 kilometres</li>\n  <li>Lara to Healesville – 107.40 kilometres</li>\n  <li>Bacchus Marsh to Stony Point – 102.75 kilometres</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So if you’re up for the best bang for your buck, the trip of 124.36 kilometres comes to a total cost of $0.03 per kilometre travelled – try beating that in a car!</p>\n\n<p>If anybody can find a further trip with the criteria set out above, please let me know below in the comments.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2018/08/10/how-far-can-you-travel-in-melbourne-for-just-4-30","relative_path":"_posts/2018-08-11-how-far-can-you-travel-in-melbourne-for-just-4-30.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Cycling"],"layout":"post","id":1911,"title":"Bicycle trip: Port Fairy to Warrnambool Rail Trail","date":"2018-10-30 05:10:00 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=1911","tags":["2018","Koroit","Port Fairy","Warrnambool"],"slug":"bicycle-trip-port-fairy-to-warrnambool-rail-trail","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>The Port Fairy to Warrnambool Rail Trail follows an old passenger and freight railway that operated as a whole from 1890 to 1977.

The total travel time of 3 hours and 47 minutes is what amounts to a pleasant journey through the countryside. Thankfully, it was a relatively empty train which allowed our bikes plenty of room in the rear luggage area. There were several other cyclists on board who alighted at various other stops along the way with rail trails, such as <a href=\"https://www.railtrails.org.au/trail?view=trail&amp;id=161\">Camperdown</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It was a wet, windy and cold day at first. It eventually cleared soon after our arrival and we had a nice day looking around before embarking on the bicycle trip on the next day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/44309336185/in/album-72157674332949128/\" title=\"Typical street in Warrnambool\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1912/44309336185_ba38ea69fc.jpg\" alt=\"Typical street in Warrnambool\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>This part of the world has some of the most beautiful sections of coastline in Australia. Middle Island and the coastal flats nearby are a haven for birds and marine life which are all immediately obvious when walking along the coastal trails south of Warrnambool’s CBD.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45169925922/in/album-72157674332949128/\" title=\"Middle Island, Warrnambool\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1957/45169925922_f15155a7ed.jpg\" alt=\"Middle Island, Warrnambool\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/44309242965/in/album-72157674332949128/\" title=\"Rocky coast, Warrnambool\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1977/44309242965_94286f94f7.jpg\" alt=\"Rocky coast, Warrnambool\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"warrnambool-to-port-fairy\">Warrnambool to Port Fairy</h2>\n\n<p>We set off soon after 7am the next day and head into town to find some breakfast. Luckily there was a <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/CTvWxTpUkKB2\">bakery</a> that was open on the day of AFL Grand Final along our route through town. Egg and bacon rolls might not be the healthiest choice, but it may be the most delicious and warming way to start a ride on a cold and wet morning.</p>\n\n<p>The first section of trail follows the Merri River into a large area of wetlands and coastal flats. The scenery here is absolutely beautiful and well worth a visit in its own right. There were hundreds of birds nesting, paddling or flying around here which provided a scenic environment while we were thoroughly drenched by the on-and-off rain.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/43407053150/in/album-72157674332949128/\" title=\"Wooden bridge crossing wetlands, Warrnambool\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1905/43407053150_8a289836e1.jpg\" alt=\"Wooden bridge crossing wetlands, Warrnambool\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>But it soon cleared and we continued north-west along the old railway alignment. While it has been well and truly picked clean of most infrastructure, you can still find remnants if you look hard enough. This includes old track, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45169791802/in/album-72157674332949128/\">mile markers</a> and station cuttings.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45219659601/in/album-72157674332949128/\" title=\"Track remnant on Port Fairy Rail Trail\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1960/45219659601_3e4bb3d1b0.jpg\" alt=\"Track remnant on Port Fairy Rail Trail\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>For one, the old station sites were very visible. The platform signs have been restored and placed in their original locations which is a very nice touch.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/44309790665/in/album-72157674332949128/\" title=\"Abandoned Crossley Station sign\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1933/44309790665_c552d82695.jpg\" alt=\"Abandoned Crossley Station sign\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>After a fair bit of riding we came to the town of Koroit. The first thing that I noticed was the smell of the <a href=\"https://www.standard.net.au/story/5533352/factorys-sale-to-bega-cheese-welcomed-by-koroit/\">Bega cheese factory</a> that lies on its outskirts. You wouldn’t think that a cheese factory would smell particularly nice, but to me it was almost like I could eat the air (I had cravings to eat cheese for the rest of the day…)</p>\n\n<p>A little further along was the beautifully-restored Koroit Station. The building has been renovated and the surroundings turned into a great park area with a playground, some benches and a picnic site.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45220175681/in/album-72157674332949128/\" title=\"Koroit Station on Warrnambool to Port Fairy Rail Trail\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1917/45220175681_0c720d6cca.jpg\" alt=\"Koroit Station on Warrnambool to Port Fairy Rail Trail\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>For the gunzels, there is an old timetable on the platform which shows the stopping patterns of the trains that used to run along this section of railway and a whole host of ghost lines and stations that no longer exist like Rosebrook and Weerite.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/43407825420/in/album-72157674332949128/\" title=\"Reprinted timetable for abandoned Koroit Station\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1946/43407825420_ac208a60f6.jpg\" alt=\"Reprinted timetable for abandoned Koroit Station\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>We were about an hour ahead of schedule and decided to take a short side trip to Tower Hill, just north of Koroit. On the map, the area was shaped like a mediaeval castle in the middle of a vast lake. It turned out to be an extinct volcano, and it is one of the most stunning geographic features that I’ve seen anywhere in Victoria. Unfortunately we didn’t have time to go into the park itself, but the view from the lookout was very inviting.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/30281905437/in/album-72157674332949128/\" title=\"Panorama of Tower Hill, Koroit\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1941/30281905437_ac6b420c07_z.jpg\" alt=\"Panorama of Tower Hill, Koroit\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The next section from Koroit to Port Fairy should have been easier than the first on account of the fact that it is all downhill.</p>\n\n<p>However, strong headwinds made this quite a slog through relatively monotonous countryside and semi-curious cows. Surprisingly, we were only swooped by magpies 4-5 times in spite of the large numbers that we saw. Many seemed to be kept busy by territorial battles with other magpies and wattlebirds.</p>\n\n<p>Arriving in Port Fairy was quite a spectacle as there was a craft market right in the middle of the trail’s end. Despite being intruiged by the rather ambitiously-named “World’s Best Sausage Rolls” stall, we continued into town to find lunch.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/43407703890/in/album-72157674332949128/\" title=\"Craft market, Port Fairy\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1968/43407703890_d4859ff42d.jpg\" alt=\"Craft market, Port Fairy\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>After lunch we had time to explore the town a little and found some nice heritage buildings along quiet tree-lined streets.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/31346899458/in/album-72157674332949128/\" title=\"Old buildings on Gipps Street, Port Fairy\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1937/31346899458_64e9a88eb8.jpg\" alt=\"Old buildings on Gipps Street, Port Fairy\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>We also did the requisite gunzelling and found this odd situation where a bus stop had two separate poles with one sign on each and blocked the other’s view.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/30281404677/in/album-72157674332949128/\" title=\"Bus stops, Port Fairy\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1918/30281404677_bb2c2e3039.jpg\" alt=\"Bus stops, Port Fairy\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The ride back was fairly uneventful (other than being swooped again by the same magpies and a short but hairy ride along the Princes Highway on the western outskirts of Warrnabool).</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in the introduction, the Friends of the Port Fairy – Warrnambool Rail Trail deserve a lot of praise for their hard work which is very visible along the whole trail.</p>\n\n<p>One of the best parts of this trip was finally learning how to reliably spell Warrnambool. This is something that has evaded me for years and will make any future typos all the more embarassing.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2018/10/30/bicycle-trip-port-fairy-to-warrnambool-rail-trail","relative_path":"_posts/2018-10-30-bicycle-trip-port-fairy-to-warrnambool-rail-trail.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"post","title":"The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things","date":"2018-10-31 07:01:35 -0500","image":"/images/post-7.jpg","tags":["notes","story","rest"],"slug":"the-way-i-see-it-every-life-is-a-pile-of-good-things","ext":".markdown","excerpt":"<p>In qua quid est boni praeter summam voluptatem, et eam sempiternam.

Confusingly for its name, the Trail currently ends at the town of Heathcote, which is around 58 kilometres from Heathcote Junction.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"image-placeholder video\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.25000000%\"><video class=\"video-js-el vjs-default-skin vjs-minimal-skin wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"\" data-vsetup=\"[]\" height=\"360\" mp4=\"\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" preload=\"auto\" src=\"https://video.relive.cc/85237520001_relive-tracker_1543787754580.mp4\" width=\"640\"><source src=\"https://video.relive.cc/85237520001_relive-tracker_1543787754580.mp4?_=3\" type=\"video/mp4\" />&lt;/source&gt;</video></span></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bendigo-to-axedale\">Bendigo to Axedale</h3>\n\n<p>We caught the first train out of Melbourne and arrived in Bendigo just after 10am. It had been a very long time since I visited the city but there was unfortunately no time to have a proper look around.</p>\n\n<p>The Trail proper begins about 2 kilometres north-east of Bendigo Station, which is accessible by either local streets or a less direct shared path that follows a creek/drain. Both routes take you past the entrance to the Bendigo Tram Depot where a lovely old W-class tram was taking a nap.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45300036365/in/album-72157701133204872/\" title=\"Bendigo tram parked outside depot\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4816/45300036365_9562d0e027_z.jpg\" alt=\"Bendigo tram parked outside depot\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Following the Trail from here takes you through an industrial area of Bendigo. This features an interesting combination of abandoned warehouses and operational light industrial facilities. There was something resembling some sort of disused school, but I can’t confirm this.</p>\n\n<p>A little further on is the locality of Strathfieldsaye. This seems like a rather odd name, and apparently it comes from the name of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratfield_Saye_House\">a mansion</a> in England that is home to the Duke of Wellington.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/46213054641/in/album-72157701133204872/\" title=\"O'Keefe Rail Trail distance signage, Bendigo\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4857/46213054641_56a50f6540_z.jpg\" alt=\"O'Keefe Rail Trail distance signage, Bendigo\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>One of the best features of this trail is the signage. Having read the comments from <a href=\"https://www.railtrails.org.au/trail?view=trail&amp;id=100\">some previous users</a> I was preparing to do a lot of map checking. However, we had very few issues with directions along the entire ride in both directions. There were identifying totems located at intersections and some cute level crossing signs that had been repurposed with the name of the trail inscribed on the front.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/31273807537/in/album-72157701133204872/\" title=\"O'Keefe Rail Trail sign\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4843/31273807537_232c81617a_z.jpg\" alt=\"O'Keefe Rail Trail sign\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>As with most rail trails in Victoria, old station sites have been restored and maintained over many years. Axedale Station is one example, where an old VR wagon has been placed on an old piece of track. While it was operational, this line carried both passengers and goods, so it is nice to see some history being preserved and exhibited.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/46162323912/in/album-72157701133204872/\" title=\"Site of former Axedale Station with VR wagon\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4898/46162323912_206f0f7865_z.jpg\" alt=\"Site of former Axedale Station with VR wagon\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Axedale was the logical place to stop for lunch. It is the approximate halfway point and has a very good pub. The town also has a scattering of heritage buildings, including a church <a href=\"https://axedalethenandnow.com/2017/06/22/how-axedale-was-named/\">built from local bluestone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/32340774648/in/album-72157701133204872/\">public hall</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45299982495/in/album-72157701133204872/\" title=\"St Mary's Church, Axedale\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4805/45299982495_03f7343d52_z.jpg\" alt=\"St Mary's Church, Axedale\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The food at the Axedale Tavern was very nice and the service prompt and friendly. If you are using the trail or driving through, it is a good place to stop and rest.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"axedale-to-heathcote\">Axedale to Heathcote</h3>\n\n<p>Due to development that occured between the closure of the railway and the opening of the path, the Trail has to divert away from the original route of the tracks for a few kilometres.</p>\n\n<p>The bad news is that this means a steep hill climb just after crossing the Campaspe River on the outskirts of Axedale. The good news is that this means you get to ride along the riverbank for a short while.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/32340754258/in/album-72157701133204872/\" title=\"Road bridge across Campaspe River, Axedale\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4810/32340754258_b513b8cd3f_z.jpg\" alt=\"Road bridge across Campaspe River, Axedale\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>It also takes you past the remains of the Quarry Hotel which overlooks the eastern bank of the River. Built in the 1870s, it is quite run down at the moment, but it was constructed primarily to service a nearby bluestone quarry that may have provided material for kerbing on St Kilda Road in Melbourne.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45488972454/in/album-72157701133204872/\" title=\"Old Quarry Hotel, Axedale\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4917/45488972454_691f893cea_z.jpg\" alt=\"Old Quarry Hotel, Axedale\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Past Knowsley, there are about 12 metal cattle grids on the path. They are well-signed, but be aware of them and don’t try to ride too quickly or slowly over them. I can imagine that they are pretty treacherous in wet weather, especially if you have narrower tyres.</p>\n\n<p>Just past the grids and about nine kilometres out from Heathcote, the path brushes along the north-eastern shore of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Eppalock\">Lake Eppalock</a>. This is the artificial lake created to supply Bendigo and surrounding areas with water. It is also the only major water storage facility in the catchment of the Campaspe River. It has only been full once in 1996, and when we rode past it looked a long way away from being at capacity.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45488958304/in/album-72157701133204872/\" title=\"Panorama of Lake Eppalock\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4909/45488958304_a87dcb3ed9_z.jpg\" alt=\"Panorama of Lake Eppalock\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>After a little more riding, we reached Heathcote. The town’s layout is a little odd, as its town centre is very linear and spread thinly along the McIvor Highway that runs through its centre. Being gazetted as a town in 1851, there are lots of old buildings that have been restored and well-maintained.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45299954545/in/album-72157701133204872/\" title=\"St John's Anglican Church, Heathcote\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4867/45299954545_c58416eaf2_z.jpg\" alt=\"St John's Anglican Church, Heathcote\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"heathcote-to-bendigo\">Heathcote to Bendigo</h3>\n\n<p>The ride back from Heathcote was a little more hurried as we had to rush to catch the second last train back to Melbourne (the last one was two hours later), and a badly-timed flat tyre about 6 kilometres out from Bendigo.</p>\n\n<p>We made it (with six minutes to spare) and arrived back in Melbourne in time for a late dinner. Plus, we were treated to a beautiful sunset and this view from the rear of the train.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/44395715090/in/album-72157701133204872/\" title=\"View from the back of a V/Line train from Bendigo\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4864/44395715090_2b02b71230_z.jpg\" alt=\"View from the back of a V/Line train from Bendigo\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n\n<p>This was one of my favourite trips so far. The Trail is one of the flattest that I have ridden and is very gradual in its descents in climbs (with the exception of the Campaspe River). This makes the round trip of approximately 106 kilometres quite doable as a day trip. Unlike some other trails, the scenery was rarely monotonous or boring and the trail surface was consistently good for all but about 800 metres of the 49 kilometre-long trail.</p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.mitchellshire.vic.gov.au/council/news-media-notices/media-releases/2017-media-releases-archive/rail-trail.html\">plans</a> to extend the Trail to Heathcote Junction to complete the abandoned railway, or even as far as Wallan. This would make a great project and make it possible to ride from one railway line to another – something that is not possible on any other rail trail in regional Victoria – and make it even more attractive for visitors and tourists like ourselves.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2018/12/10/bicycle-trip-okeefe-rail-trail","relative_path":"_posts/2018-12-10-bicycle-trip-okeefe-rail-trail.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport tips"],"layout":"post","id":1937,"title":"Transport tip of the month &#8211; changing from buses to trains at Victoria Park Station","date":"2018-12-12 14:00:36 -0600","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=1937","tags":["2018","Bus","Hoddle Street","Hurstbridge Line","Mernda Line","Train","Victoria Park Station"],"slug":"transport-tip-of-the-month-changing-from-buses-to-trains-at-victoria-park-station","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p><em>tl;dr version – if you are on a citybound bus on the Eastern Freeway and want to change to a Mernda/Hurstbridge train, get off at the Truro Street bus stop and walk to Victoria Park Station via Truro Street instead of Johnston Street.</em></p>\n","content":"<p><em>tl;dr version – if you are on a citybound bus on the Eastern Freeway and want to change to a Mernda/Hurstbridge train, get off at the Truro Street bus stop and walk to Victoria Park Station via Truro Street instead of Johnston Street.</em></p>\n\n<p>This tip is quite well known among regular passengers on Eastern Freeway buses who need to change to the Mernda/Hurstbridge Lines.

Spending my childhood in this area means that I have fond memories of both the Union Road and Hamilton Street shops (Breadstreet anyone?) and many years of travelling on various modes through and into the neighbourhood. This should explain my particular interest in these two projects.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-could-happen\">What could happen?</h2>\n\n<p>The LXRA has already indicated a preference for rail under road solutions at both level crossings. This is before any detailed technical investigations or plans have been done and have yet to be confirmed. However, the characteristics of the area would probably suggest this type of design anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Grades on this section of track are generally a constant uphill climb from Canterbury Station through Chatham, Surrey Hills and Mont Albert Stations. The track then levels out after Mont Albert and descends into the underground station at Box Hill.</p>\n\n<p>We can work out the possible start and end points for the trench by looking at this diagram and the current features of the area.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SurreyHillsMontAlbertLevelCrossingGradient.jpg\"><img src=\"https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SurreyHillsMontAlbertLevelCrossingGradient-1024x552.jpg\" alt=\"Elevation profile of railway line between Canterbury and Box Hill showing a consitent rise until halfway between Mont Albert and Box Hill and then a slight decline in gradient into Box Hill Station\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>For the possible trench entrance, there is a current road underpass Robinson Road off Canterbury Road that allows access under the tracks for vehicles (not pedestrians). The distance between this underpass and the Union Road level crossing is 367 metres with an elevation gain of 11 metres. This seems sufficient room to have only a slight downward trajectory for a new track through the trench, if any at all.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/31463762037/in/dateposted/\" title=\"Chatham Station, Surrey Hills\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4822/31463762037_d3c3f7416c_z.jpg\" alt=\"Chatham Station, Surrey Hills\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>It would then be a steady climb up to Mont Albert Station from Surrey Hills.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45491038135/in/dateposted/\" title=\"Railway between Surrey Hills and Mont Albert Stations looking north\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4827/45491038135_50c989cfa9_z.jpg\" alt=\"Railway between Surrey Hills and Mont Albert Stations looking north\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>The point at which the gradient levels out before Box Hill is just before the Creswick Lane underpass west of Elgar Road. This would seem the logical point for the trench to return to the present track to avoid having to rebuild or reconfigure the rail bridge over Elgar Road.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-does-it-look-like-now\">What does it look like now?</h2>\n\n<p>Being a Boroondara local and familiar with the area, I had a look around yesterday to document the area before any works begin.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing to note is that I spent a total of about 6-7 minutes around the Union Road level crossing. Even in that short space of time, no fewer than three vehicles stopped over the tracks at three different times. It seems that some people <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/train-and-car-collide-at-surrey-hills-station-20160914-grg9w1.html\">have very short memories</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/32531090458/in/dateposted/\" title=\"Cars stopped across Union Road level crossing, Surrey Hills\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4827/32531090458_454eaa459c_z.jpg\" alt=\"Cars stopped across Union Road level crossing, Surrey Hills\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Both stations have quaint shopping strips nearby, Union Road being a larger centre with a new Coles supermarket. Mont Albert also has the distinction of hosting the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/46352456742/in/datetaken/\">Railfan shop!</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45490833795/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Hamilton Street shops from railway station, Mont Albert\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4843/45490833795_d68d31c3db_z.jpg\" alt=\"Hamilton Street shops from railway station, Mont Albert\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Both suburbs are very pleasant to visit and walk around. I can highly recommend a route from Canterbury Station up through to Box Hill along the railway line if you want to have a look at the neighbourhood. There are lots of leafy streets, historic houses and hidden parks along the way.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-main-challenges\">What are the main challenges?</h2>\n\n<p>While the geography might be somewhat more straightforward than some other level crossings around Melbourne, there are some complicating factors that will need to be considered.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"heritage-and-planning\">Heritage and planning</h3>\n\n<p>The station buildings at Surrey Hills are not heritage listed, nor is the land subject to any planning scheme overlays. However, there is a Floodway Overlay just north of the station along Bedford Avenue. Such a constraint has not stopped <a href=\"https://levelcrossings.vic.gov.au/media/videos/three-boom-gates-removed-in-bentleigh,-mckinnon-and-ormond\">recent level crossing removals</a> from having rail under road in areas subject to flooding, but it will be something that will have to be dealt with in both the trench and station designs.</p>\n\n<p>There was a heritage study of the area completed in 2011 for Boroondara Council which led to the creation of a Heritage Overlay (HO532) over the shopping centre. However, this specifically excluded the railway line, level crossing and station area due to their reconfiguration and modification during the addition of the third track in the 1970s.</p>\n\n<p>However, Mont Albert Station is included in a heritage overlay (HO27 in the Whitehorse Planning Scheme). While it is not listed in the Victorian Heritage Register, these planning controls may present some difficulties. Built in 1910-1911, it is a very quaint and attractive feature. It is also the <a href=\"http://bpadula.tripod.com/montalbert/id11.html\">oldest railway building</a> in the City of Whitehorse.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/44586480230/in/dateposted/\" title=\"Mont Albert Station building\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4852/44586480230_584dba1d5a_z.jpg\" alt=\"Mont Albert Station building\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>Hopefully it can be retained given its location to the side of the station platforms.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"traffic\">Traffic</h3>\n\n<p>Another challenge will be increased traffic on both roads – particularly on Union Road. Ancedotally I am aware of many people who will avoid Union Road specifically because of the level crossing. When it is gone, it is not unreasonable to expect increased traffic volumes as cars are able to move more freely through the local shopping centre. This is something that will have to be managed by the appropriate authorities when the time comes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vegetation\">Vegetation</h3>\n\n<p>One final issue that springs to mind is the significant amount of mature vegetation that directly abuts the rail reserve. Much of what makes Surrey Hills and Mont Albert such pleasant places is the generous and thick tree cover along local streets and roads. Presumably there will be at least some vegetation that will have to be removed as part of the works. Making sure that this does not significantly detract from the local landscape will be an interesting challenge for the LXRA to manage.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/46403534831/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Beresford Street looking south-west, Mont Albert\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4905/46403534831_da7a3fd6e1_z.jpg\" alt=\"Beresford Street looking south-west, Mont Albert\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>This is not an exhaustive list by any means. I am sure that other issues will emerge and be considered once the design process commences.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"does-this-remove-all-level-crossings-on-the-belgravelilydale-lines\">Does this remove all level crossings on the Belgrave/Lilydale Lines?</h2>\n\n<p>Not quite.</p>\n\n<p>The LXRA, <a href=\"https://levelcrossings.vic.gov.au/media/publications/priority-level-crossing-removal-sites-surrey-hills-and-mont-albert\">in their factsheet</a>, claim:</p>\n\n<p><em>“Removing the Union Road and Mont Albert Road level crossings would mean all crossings between the CBD and Ringwood had been removed”</em></p>\n\n<p>This is not actually correct.</p>\n\n<p>I alluded to this point in the introduction to this post. There is still one more level crossing between Flinders Street and Ringwood that will remain: the pedestrian level crossing at Bank Street/Rutland Road in Box Hill.</p>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!4v1545370999157!6m8!1m7!1suQUhUiU4kTfKhpyEh83m9g!2m2!1d-37.82004651889618!2d145.1284095800106!3f194.44782354590137!4f-8.79434472856363!5f1.1924812503605782\" style=\"border: 0\" width=\"600\"></iframe>\n\n<p>This level crossing between Laburnum and Box Hill was not removed as part of the redevelopment of Box Hill Station and grade separation of Station Street in 1985, nor as part of the <a href=\"http://vicsig.net/infrastructure/projects/mrp\">Middleborough Road level crossing removal</a> in 2007.</p>\n\n<p>There are also still three road level crossings between Ringwood and Belgrave (Bedford Road, Alpine Street and Railway Avenue) and five road level crossings between Ringwood and Lilydale (Dublin Road, Coolstore Road, Manchester Road [<a href=\"https://levelcrossings.vic.gov.au/projects/manchester-road-mooroolbark\">being removed</a>], Melba Avenue and Maroondah Highway [<a href=\"https://levelcrossings.vic.gov.au/projects/maroondah-highway-lilydale\">being removed</a>]).

But if you are willing to make one change and the timetables line up, you can save yourself a good 10-15 minutes (depending on the day and time).</p>\n\n<p>The trick is to counterintuitively catch the 200 <em>away</em> from the city (i.e. towards Bulleen) and get off at the last stop before the Eastern Freeway. Then it’s a 200 metre (2 minute) walk to the bus stop on the on ramp for the Eastern Freeway, where you can catch the 905.</p>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m28!1m12!1m3!1d3153.3496066950743!2d145.0769712009224!3d-37.781845842843396!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m13!3e2!4m5!1s0x6ad646c43f75f73d%3A0xdc682d311b107549!2sLeonis+Av!3m2!1d-37.7827115!2d145.0782514!4m5!1s0x6ad646c3f3aafaad%3A0xef78ed64d1363b90!2sEastern+Fwy!3m2!1d-37.7809721!2d145.078251!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sau!4v1543224022275\" style=\"border:0\" width=\"400\"></iframe>\n\n<p>The 905 will run express along the Eastern Freeway to Hoddle Street, where it turns left and continues along Victoria Parade and into the CBD.

Three of the five new stations (State Library, Town Hall and Anzac) will be located within its boundaries, bringing the total number up to seven.</p>\n\n<p>It could also be argued that Parliament Station is technically located partially in <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/458461654\">East Melbourne</a> and that Richmond Station is located partially in the <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4681252024\">Melbourne CBD</a>. This doesn’t change the total number, but if you are pedantic then this could be something to think about.</p>\n\n<p>So if you live in Northcote or Camberwell, consider yourself lucky to have more railway stations than any other suburb!</p>\n","url":"/blog/2019/01/30/which-melbourne-suburb-has-the-most-railway-stations","relative_path":"_posts/2019-01-31-which-melbourne-suburb-has-the-most-railway-stations.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport"],"layout":"post","id":2098,"title":"Station patronage in Victoria for 2013-2018","date":"2019-02-13 14:00:39 -0600","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2098","tags":["Data"],"slug":"station-patronage-in-victoria-2013-2018","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>I have recently acquired patronage data for all railway stations in Victoria between 2013-2018.</p>\n","content":"<p>I have recently acquired patronage data for all railway stations in Victoria between 2013-2018.</p>\n\n<p>After requests to Public Transport Victoria and V/Line were answered last week, I compiled this data into two spreadsheets for your viewing pleasure:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KexrKIt8iMqW2qVamgTJ1FWkm63NUBfT/view?usp=sharing\">V/Line station patronage 2013 – 2017</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E1sDXTMRQ9uXYQdV6XAO0W2iZA8f54v2/view?usp=sharing\">Metropolitan station patraonge 2014-2018</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I will be writing a series of posts interrogating this data more closely over the coming weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n","url":"/blog/2019/02/13/station-patronage-in-victoria-2013-2018","relative_path":"_posts/2019-02-14-station-patronage-in-victoria-2013-2018.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport"],"layout":"post","id":2107,"title":"Which are the least and most used stations in Victoria?","date":"2019-02-20 14:00:17 -0600","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2107","tags":["Data"],"slug":"which-are-the-least-and-most-used-stations-in-victoria","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>As mentioned in <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2019/02/14/station-patronage-in-victoria-2013-2018/\">a previous post</a>, I recently acquired station patronage data for Melbourne and Victoria for 2013 to 2018.</p>\n","content":"<p>As mentioned in <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2019/02/14/station-patronage-in-victoria-2013-2018/\">a previous post</a>, I recently acquired station patronage data for Melbourne and Victoria for 2013 to 2018.</p>\n\n<p>This means that we can now play with the data!</p>\n\n<p>One of the first questions that comes up when looking at station usage data is which stations are have the highest and lowest numbers of passengers.</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"which-is-the-least-used-station-in-victoria\">Which is the least used station in Victoria?</h3>\n\n<p>It should come as no surprise that the 10 least used stations in the state are all in regional/country Victoria:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Station</th>\n      <th>Patronage (yearly)</th>\n      <th>Line</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Elmore</td>\n      <td>884</td>\n      <td>Echuca</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Talbot</td>\n      <td>1,121</td>\n      <td>Maryborough</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Creswick</td>\n      <td>1,143</td>\n      <td>Maryborough</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Springhurst</td>\n      <td>1,566</td>\n      <td>Albury</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Essendon</td>\n      <td>1,645</td>\n      <td>Seymour</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Sherwood Park</td>\n      <td>1,814</td>\n      <td>Warrnambool</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Avenel</td>\n      <td>2,118</td>\n      <td>Albury</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Clunes</td>\n      <td>2,136</td>\n      <td>Maryborough</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Berwick</td>\n      <td>2,140</td>\n      <td>Traralgon</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Pyramid</td>\n      <td>2,670</td>\n      <td>Swan Hill</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Elmore takes out the title of being the least used station in Victoria for 2016-17 with 884 recorded boardings – that’s just 2.42 people per day!

The V/Line data is regional passengers only.</p>\n\n<p>This data also does not take into account passengers interchanging (particularly at places like Richmond), staff opening myki gates during disruptions, fare evasion or other irregularities. The gate configuration at Caulfield also leads to an overestimate of patronage, as with previous numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Other notes and details on data collection may be found in the original spreadsheets, available <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2019/02/14/station-patronage-in-victoria-2013-2018/\">here</a>.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2019/02/20/which-are-the-least-and-most-used-stations-in-victoria","relative_path":"_posts/2019-02-21-which-are-the-least-and-most-used-stations-in-victoria.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport"],"layout":"post","id":2024,"title":"The fastest way to get from the city to La Trobe University","date":"2019-02-27 14:00:42 -0600","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2024","tags":["La Trobe University"],"slug":"the-fastest-way-to-get-from-the-city-to-la-trobe-university","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>With uni starting up again this month, it is worthwhile for students, staff and visitors to have a good look at the various public transport options for their respective universities.

I am also using the Agora at La Trobe University as the destination (being the hub of most activity on the campus).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/42843727081/\" title=\"The Agora, La Trobe University\"><img src=\"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1751/42843727081_6dda71fe4c_z.jpg\" alt=\"The Agora, La Trobe University\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>From what I know, these are the most common five public transport options for this journey (in no particular order):</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Route 86 tram to Kingsbury Drive</li>\n  <li>Mernda train to Reservoir, then the 301 express bus to La Trobe University Interchange</li>\n  <li>Hurstbridge train to Macleod, then the 561 bus to Kingsbury Drive</li>\n  <li>350 bus from Lonsdale Street to La Trobe University Interchange</li>\n  <li>250 bus from Lonsdale Street to La Trobe University Interchange</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are theoretically tens more possible combinations. These are just the ones that I think are the most practical and/or common.</p>\n\n<p>To answer the question requires knowing the day and time. During weekday morning peak, your best bet would be a <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/view/5/\">train to Reservoir </a>and changing to the <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/timetables/linemain/10952/\">301 bus</a>. However, during the afternoon peak, the <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/timetables/linemain/8606/\">350 bus</a> will probably be a little bit quicker (and is also a single seat journey). On a weekend, the <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/timetables/linemain/8135/\">250 bus</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/timetables/linemain/1881/\">86 tram</a> are your best options – mainly because the 301 and 350 buses do not operate on weekends.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/40675364762/\" title=\"Reservoir Station platform sign\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4801/40675364762_82cf1c1bc0_z.jpg\" alt=\"Reservoir Station platform sign\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script></p>\n\n<p>These answers rely on scheduled timetables, so the other major factor to consider when deciding on your journey is reliability. Given their general lack of separation from traffic and priority, buses and trams are more suseptable to unexpected delays, particularly during peak times.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, there is no single answer to this transport question. The scheduled time differences between each option are not significant, so your main consideration may be reliability. In this case, the train to Reservoir followed by a bus would probably be your best choice.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2019/02/27/the-fastest-way-to-get-from-the-city-to-la-trobe-university","relative_path":"_posts/2019-02-28-the-fastest-way-to-get-from-the-city-to-la-trobe-university.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport"],"layout":"post","id":2109,"title":"Which station in Melbourne has the fastest-growing patronage?","date":"2019-03-06 14:00:38 -0600","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2109","tags":["Data"],"slug":"which-station-in-melbourne-has-the-fastest-growing-patronage","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>This post continues a series analysing <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2019/02/14/station-patronage-in-victoria-2013-2018/\">station patronage data</a> for Melbourne and Victoria from 2013 to 2018.

Note that there are two data gaps in the 2012-13 and 2014-15 financial years.</p>\n\n<p>Analysing this combined information yielded some surprising results (to me anyway).</p>\n\n<p>These are the top 10 stations with the greatest difference between 2008-09 and 2017-18 patronage:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Rank</th>\n      <th>Station</th>\n      <th>Patronage growth (2008-09 to 2017-18)</th>\n      <th>Line Group</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Southern Cross</td>\n      <td>5,524,710</td>\n      <td>Inner City / City Loop</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>Flinders Street</td>\n      <td>3,519,528</td>\n      <td>Inner City / City Loop</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>Richmond</td>\n      <td>2,113,555</td>\n      <td>Inner City / City Loop</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>South Yarra</td>\n      <td>1,888,078</td>\n      <td>Inner City / City Loop</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>Caulfield</td>\n      <td>1,573,269</td>\n      <td>Caulfield</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>Footscray</td>\n      <td>1,552,519</td>\n      <td>Northern</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>Melbourne Central</td>\n      <td>942,695</td>\n      <td>Inner City / City Loop</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>Box Hill</td>\n      <td>635,361</td>\n      <td>Burnley</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>North Melbourne</td>\n      <td>612,229</td>\n      <td>Northern</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>Craigieburn</td>\n      <td>586,553</td>\n      <td>Northern</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Craigieburn stands out in these rankings as a non-inner city location. Its patronage almost doubled from 575,925 in 2008-09 to 1,162,477 in 2017-18. This is almost certainly due to the huge amounts of urban sprawl being constructed in that corridor. Part of this growth may also be due to increases in employment opportunities nearby and interchanges to/from V/Line services on the Seymour Line.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Southern Cross (Spencer Street) Station looking south from footbridge](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7757/17230232553_44f9e75565_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/17230232553/)</figure>\n<p>The table above shows absolute passenger numbers. When you look at growth as a percentage over the same period, a very different picture emerges:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Rank</th>\n      <th>Station</th>\n      <th>Patronage growth % (2008-09 to 2017-18)</th>\n      <th>Line Group</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Officer</td>\n      <td>77%</td>\n      <td>Caulfield</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>Richmond</td>\n      <td>51%</td>\n      <td>Inner City / City Loop</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>Craigieburn</td>\n      <td>50%</td>\n      <td>Northern</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>North Richmond</td>\n      <td>49%</td>\n      <td>Clifton Hill</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>South Kensington</td>\n      <td>49%</td>\n      <td>Northern</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>West Footscray</td>\n      <td>48%</td>\n      <td>Northern</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>North Melbourne</td>\n      <td>47%</td>\n      <td>Inner City / City Loop</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>West Richmond</td>\n      <td>45%</td>\n      <td>Clifton Hill</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>Westall</td>\n      <td>43%</td>\n      <td>Caulfield</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>Jolimont</td>\n      <td>43%</td>\n      <td>Clifton Hill</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Officer is the obvious standout in this table with the largest growth across metropolitan Melbourne by a large margin. As noted in <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2019/02/21/which-are-the-least-and-most-used-stations-in-victoria/\">a previous post</a>, the station is located in the heart of the large amounts of growth in the south-east of Melbourne. In 2015, this sub-region made it into the top 10 areas of largest population growth <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/3218.0Main%20Features252015-16?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=3218.0&amp;issue=2015-16&amp;num=&amp;view=\">measured by the ABS</a>. As a result, the number of people using this station in 2008-09 was 21,479 compared to 91,956 in 2017-18.</p>\n\n<p>Only Craigieburn, Richmond and North Melbourne make it into both tables. Some of the other seven stations in the top 10 as a percentage are mostly located where significant increases in population have occured over the past decade, such as Officer and North Melbourne.</p>\n\n<p>It is interesting that North Melbourne has retained its growth despite V/Line trains no longer servicing the station after the construction of Regional Rail Link.</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"data-notes\">Data notes</h3>\n\n<p>A usual word of warning on this data – the gate configuration at some stations like South Yarra and Caulfield tend to overestimate patronage due to people having to touch on and off again in order to interchange. It also doesn’t take into account fare evasion, paper tickets, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I have excluded newly-built stations like Williams Landing and Mernda for obvious reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Stony Point Line stations were not included in the 2008-2014 data. This means that they were excluded from this analysis.</p>\n\n<p>A final note that this post took me much longer than usual on account of an annoying anachronism between the two lots of station data. For some reason, the alphabetical order was incorrect for some names in the 2015-18 data. For example, Ringwood and Ringwood East were in different orders on different spreadsheets. This resulted in much more effort than was necessary to amalgamate the data.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2019/03/06/which-station-in-melbourne-has-the-fastest-growing-patronage","relative_path":"_posts/2019-03-07-which-station-in-melbourne-has-the-fastest-growing-patronage.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["History"],"layout":"post","id":2162,"title":"Visit to the Army Tank Museum, Puckapunyal","date":"2019-03-13 15:00:56 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2162","header_position":["inherit"],"header_fullwidth":["inherit"],"page_header_styling":["inherit"],"heading_title":["0"],"custom_logo":[""],"custom_logo_width":[""],"custom_menu_skin":["default"],"sticky_menu_on_page":["default"],"custom_sticky_logo":[""],"sticky_menu_skin":["default"],"section_logo_switch":["0"],"footer_visibility":["inherit"],"fixed_footer":["inherit"],"footer_fullwidth":["inherit"],"featured_image_placing":["default"],"post_image_size":["inherit"],"page_custom_css":[""],"slide_template":["default"],"rs_page_bg_color":["#ffffff"],"tags":["Military"],"slug":"army-tank-museum-puckapunyal","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>One of the many things on my ever-expanding list of places to see in Victoria was the Royal Australian Armoured Corps (RAAC) Army Tank Museum in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puckapunyal\">Puckapuynal</a>.

As the Museum is only open on some weekdays (Tuesday to Friday), it needs some planning in order to visit for someone in full-time employment.</p>\n\n<p>Having now ticket it off my list, I can definitely say that it is absolutely worth going. We’re lucky to have this museum in Victoria, as many other military collections are <a href=\"https://www.army.gov.au/our-history/army-museum-network/corps-museums\">scattered right across the country</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"getting-there\">Getting there</h3>\n\n<p>It may be possible in theory to get to the Museum by public transport from Melbourne. It would involve catching a V/Line service to Seymour and then an <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/2896/3-seymour-puckapunyal/\">intertown bus</a> to Puckapunyal. Unfortunately, there is an annoying service gap of about 4 hours to return to Seymour which means that you have to choose between spending 30 minutes or four hours at the Museum.</p>\n\n<p>However, given that the Museum is located within an active military base, complete with checkpoints and vehicle searches, I’m not actually sure if any old person could simply board the bus and get off at a stop within the base. Perhaps the base guards check the bus at the checkpoint when it enters? I’ve sent an inquiry to PTV so I’ll update this once I hear back.</p>\n\n<p>Update: PTV sent back a response to my inquiry via Mitchell Transit, the bus company:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You must have a name/address of who you are visiting and a reason for entering the base. You must also carry photo identification and obtain a visitors pass. If you are visiting the tank museum – paperwork must be completed prior to your visit. Access to the base is up to the base security – not the bus company. If you need further clarification I suggest you contact the base direct as we can accept no responsibility if you are denied access to the base.</p>\n\n  <p>Please note if you are denied access then you must remain at the gate until the bus returns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately this information has not been added to the website or timetable. Hopefully it will soon.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/46601819034/in/dateposted/\" title=\"Mitchell Transit bus, Seymour\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7924/46601819034_3295977d81_z.jpg\" alt=\"Mitchell Transit bus, Seymour\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it seemed too much of a hassle to get there using public transport (even for me), so I borrowed a car and drove.</p>\n\n<p>The base is close to the Hume Freeway which makes it easily accessible. You have to drive another 10 minutes or so down a side road and turn into the base access drive.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, this is an active military installation. There are guards at the entrance who conduct a vehicle search and inspection (who are very friendly too). You have to get out of the car, show photo ID and tell them your destination in order to get a visitors lanyard to be allowed inside. Then there are strict instructions to drive directly to and from the Museum. They call ahead and you have only a few minutes in which to arrive, otherwise they call the MPs and you’re in quite a bit of strife. Needless to say, any video or photography anywhere other than inside the Museum is prohibited.</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"main-museum-building\">Main museum building</h3>\n\n<p>The Museum is made up of two main sections. The first is inside the entrance building, which is fairly small but full of historical items.</p>\n\n<p>It costs $8:50 to enter for adults, with a concession price of $5:00 also available. If my memory serves me correctly, I think that there is also a family ticket costing $20:00. This gives you access to both sections.</p>\n\n<p>The indoor area is organised in semi-chronological order. Beginning with the Australian Light Horse from the Boer War through to the First World War, the displays guide you through the various conflicts, peacekeeping and peacemaking operations that Australian forces have been involved in right up until the present day and the Second Gulf War.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/46399236995/in/album-72157677052120757/\" title=\"Inside the Army Tank Museum 2, Puckapunyal\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7828/46399236995_d205b768cf_z.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the Army Tank Museum 2, Puckapunyal\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>Not all of the items directly related to armour or vehicles. I think that this is a good thing, as it provides historical context and extra information that is usually very interesting. Some of the displays are dated and seem like they need a bit of sprucing up to show off their true significance and information. For example, this example below is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austen_submachine_gun\">Austen Gun</a> (an Australian modification of the British Sten Gun) next to the Australian-designed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Gun\">Owen Gun</a> – an excellent weapon in many respects. Due to the lack of labels, the significance of these two weapons in amongst a crowd of Lee-Enfield and Kar 98 rifles would probably have been lost.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/32372199427/in/album-72157677052120757/\" title=\"Austen gun and Owen gun side by side in Army Tank Museum\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7869/32372199427_cc7f5c64a3_z.jpg\" alt=\"Austen gun and Owen gun side by side in Army Tank Museum\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>Overall though, the exhibits were fascinating and well-curated. Given my particular interest in the Second World War I was naturally drawn to those first. However, there were equally interesting items from other conflicts including the Vietnam War, training exercies and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Operation_in_Somalia_II\">1993-95 Somalia peacekeeping operations</a>.</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"outdoor-museum-area\">Outdoor museum area</h3>\n\n<p>Of course the main thing that people come here to visit is to see the over 90 vehicles that the Museum has on display in various sheds and warehouses around its grounds. I have spent my life reading about them and looking at photos but had previously never had the opportunity to see most of them ‘in the flesh’.</p>\n\n<p>Being the RAAC Museum, the focus is primarily on Australia. This means that there are some vehicles here that I suspect would be seen in very few other places in the world – if any at all. This would particularly be the case with the only Australian-designed and built tank in history (the Sentinal), of which only 65 were ever made, as well as the various modified tanks, APCs and other exhibits.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/32372303037/in/album-72157677052120757/\" title=\"Sentinal tank 2, Army Tank Museum\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7911/32372303037_7fc6f9124b_z.jpg\" alt=\"Sentinal tank 2, Army Tank Museum\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>I particularly enjoyed one small area in the corner of the yard which housed several Matilda tanks. Despite their squat appearance and slow speed (they were named after a children’s character called ‘Matilda’ who was a duck), they are one of my favourite tanks of the Second World War. There were several variants of the tank that I did not know about. This included the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_II#Australian_use_in_the_Pacific_theatre\">Australian modification</a> where anti-submarine mortars (‘Hedgehogs’) were fitted onto the rear of the vehicle in order to provide close infantry support.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/47314375651/in/dateposted/\" title=\"Matilda Hedgehog tank, Army Tank Museum\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7878/47314375651_56b84bd6e0_z.jpg\" alt=\"Matilda Hedgehog tank, Army Tank Museum\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>There were many other vehicles, artillery pieces and other items from the Second World War throughout the first two sheds. Some of the vehicles are parked behind others so you have to do a little hunting around to find them. Some of the smaller one, like the Bren Carriers, have such a low profile that they almost entirely hide behind the tanks parked in front of them.</p>\n\n<p>After the World War Two exhibits you start to see more from the Cold War era. Given that Australia has only operated four different types of tanks post-WW2, an exhibit made up entirely of these vehicles wouldn’t be very big. Instead, the Museum have made a good decision to include an entire warehouse filled with Eastern Bloc tanks and vehicles. This includes one of the famous <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/46409485535/in/album-72157677052120757/\">BMP armoured fighting vehicles</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/33448492878/in/album-72157677052120757/\">captured Chinese command vehicle</a> and what I think is a T-72 tank.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/46409357975/in/album-72157677052120757/\" title=\"Russian tank, Army Tank Museum\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7861/46409357975_c0d4b446a3_z.jpg\" alt=\"Russian tank, Army Tank Museum\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>The final part of the outdoor area is modern Australian armoured vehicles. There are several APCs and other types scattered around the area. The LAV-25 is probably one of the more iconic pieces of equipment used by the Australian Army in recent decades, having seen service in many theatres.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/32382347587/in/album-72157677052120757/\" title=\"LAV-25 Armoured fighting vehicle, Army Tank Museum\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7892/32382347587_a695c5ccfe_z.jpg\" alt=\"LAV-25 Armoured fighting vehicle, Army Tank Museum\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>The ‘Hall of Technology’ followed with an interesting display of one of the 103 Leopard 1 tanks acquired by the Australian Army over the 1970s and 1980s. This particular one has been cut in half, allowing visitors to walk in between the two sections and have a close look at the interior.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/33448760148/in/dateposted/\" title=\"Leopard tank, Army Tank Museum\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7893/33448760148_018ceb074d_z.jpg\" alt=\"Leopard tank, Army Tank Museum\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>Within the hall is an area where restoration and maintenance of the collection takes place and several smaller rooms with exhibits about many of the other parts of the Army that support armoured and motorised units. This includes signals, supply and maintenance formations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n\n<p>Although it is a bit of a hike out to the country, a trip to the Tank Museum is definitely worthwhile. If you are even remotely interested in any military history, not necessarily armour, then you will find this a very interesting place.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2019/03/13/army-tank-museum-puckapunyal","relative_path":"_posts/2019-03-14-army-tank-museum-puckapunyal.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Cities"],"layout":"post","id":2036,"title":"How many Keilors are there?","date":"2019-03-27 15:00:00 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2036","tags":["Geographic names"],"slug":"how-many-keilors-are-there","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>Many suburbs’ names come from existing place names across Melbourne – some are recycled several times.</p>\n","content":"<p>Many suburbs’ names come from existing place names across Melbourne – some are recycled several times.</p>\n\n<p>Keilor is one example of this phenomenon.

It also has a branch of McDonald’s with some <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/zoHGp1H9xa52\">interesting reviews</a>.</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"kealba\">Kealba</h3>\n\n<p>It may not be immediately obvious, but this name is a <a href=\"https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/portmanteau\">portmanteau</a> of Keilor and St Albans. Formerly known as St Albans East, the name was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kealba,_Victoria#History\">officially changed</a> in the mid to late-1970s.</p>\n\n<p>The word ‘Kealba’ apparently came from a community group appointed by St Albans Park Secondary College in 1970 (now Kealba Secondary College) to come up with a new name for the school. This was to avoid confusion with St Albans Park High School. Other names put forward for consideration were ‘Albakei’ and ‘Keialba’.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the suburb contains a landfill and several residential subdivisions.</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"keilor-plains\">Keilor Plains</h3>\n\n<p>The list here now takes us into non-gazetted suburb names. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keilor_Plains_railway_station\">Keilor Plains Station</a> is actually located in St Albans and has no associated suburb name. I can only assume that they named it this way when it opened in 2002 to avoid confusion with the existing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans_railway_station,_Melbourne\">St Albans Station</a> and to avoid tying the name to any single one of the many Keilors that it was built to serve.</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"keilor-views\">Keilor Views</h3>\n\n<p>While this is not an officially-gazetted suburb name, there is a small part of Keilor Downs known apparently as ‘Keilor Views’. There are some indications of this online, but the only solid evidence that I could find is the name of a <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/WFWWHgAzgEm\">school.</a></p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"keilor-west\">Keilor West</h3>\n\n<p>This was not one that I was expecting to find. The name appears to be a simple typographical error when referring to Keilor East. I thought that this might be an alternative name for parts of Keilor Downs but the only references that I can find using the ‘Keilor West’ name refer to areas in Keilor East only. These range from <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/eleven-arrested-as-rifles-drugs-cash-cars-seized-in-raids-in-melbournes-west-20150203-134ow5.html\">articles in The Age</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ses.vic.gov.au/get-ready/your-local-flood-information/moonee-valley-city-council\">SES flood information</a>.</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"keilor-south\">Keilor South</h3>\n\n<p>This is another locality name used principally by a school. It seems to used in some southern parts of Keilor East but there is scant evidence of this once again. The only other reliable instances of this name include a <a href=\"https://results.aec.gov.au/20499/website/HousePollingPlaceFirstPrefs-20499-4594.htm\">VEC polling place</a> and some local businesses.</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"how-many-is-that-again\">How many is that again?</h3>\n\n<p>Excluding the dubious ‘Keilor West’, that adds up to no fewer than 10 suburb/locality names containing Keilor. There are many more examples around Melbourne, such as Sunshine, Cranbourne and Camberwell, if you are interested in looking further into this topic.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2019/03/27/how-many-keilors-are-there","relative_path":"_posts/2019-03-28-how-many-keilors-are-there.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport"],"layout":"post","id":2211,"title":"Melbourne bus patronage data 2008 &#8211; 2017","date":"2019-04-04 14:58:42 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2211","tags":["Bus","Data"],"slug":"melbourne-bus-patronage-data-2008-2017","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p><em>Download the data <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rf0B74BxwkBedQ8RExe0W0r5Rto6_7cu/view?usp=sharing\">here</a>.

This is the one that I used on my inbound leg.</p>\n\n<p>It involves using the little-known section of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonee_Ponds_Creek_Trail\">Moonee Ponds Creek Trail</a> that continues north from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ring_Road_Trail\">M80 Ring Road Trail.</a> Bikes can then enter the Airport via an access road from the east (see the map above for details).</p>\n\n<p>North of Willowbrook Reserve in Westmeadows is the least-populated length of a metropolitan trail that I have seen. For this entire area up to Melbourne Airport, I did not see a single person.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Moonee Ponds Creek Trail, Westmeadows](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4916/46482942451_3d2baea6a6_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/46482942451/in/album-72157704993851125/)</figure>\n<p>The low usage of this route shows more the further out you travel. Paved surfaces turn to gravel or dirt, the smoothness deteriorates and you feel more and more like you are in the countryside. This was underscored for me when I came across this abandoned car that had been left in the middle of the path in Attwood.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Abandoned car on Moonee Ponds Creek Trail, Attwood](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7874/44665837210_61c95a013f_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/44665837210/in/album-72157704993851125/)</figure>\n<p>From this point at the entrance to the Woodlands Historic Park, the route becomes less legible. You have to continue along the main path around the western part of the Park where there is a fork in the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail. There is also a bench at this point which gives you a wonderful view of aircraft taking off and landing from both runways.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![View looking towards Melbourne Airport from Woodlands Historic Park, Greenvale](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7906/45569684065_969743cac2_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45569684065/in/album-72157704993851125/)</figure>\n<p>Continuing down this path brings you to Marker Road. This is effectively a service track for navigation aids built and maintained by Melbourne Airport for Runway 09/27 (the east-west runway). The surface is very rough to the point where it requires dismounting in some places.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Surface of Marker Road, Melbourne Airport](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7841/31542869537_fe7211d925_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/31542869537/in/album-72157704993851125/)</figure>\n<p>After a steep climb and a short ride along a much smoother surface at the top of the hill, Marker Road intersects with the southbound off-ramp from Sunbury Road into Melbourne Airport. From here, you can ride all the way to the terminals and car parking building where the bicycle parking is located (see below). Otherwise, there are footpaths along most of the roads where you can walk your bike if the traffic is too hairy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Entrance to Melbourne Airport from Marker Road](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7920/31542856977_05e73501e8_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/31542856977/in/album-72157704993851125/)</figure>\n<p>The main advantage of this route is that it is almost entirely off-road, but the degree to which this is true will depend on your trip origin. You should also be prepared for at least some on-road riding through the Airport surrounds. There are footpaths in some places where you can walk your bike if that proves too hairy to negotiate.</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"route-2--via-airport-drive\">Route 2 – via Airport Drive</h3>\n\n<p>Another way to travel to and from the Airport by bike is using the network of shared paths that have been recently built to the south of the main terminal area. While there are <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/-37.68105/144.86169\">some gaps</a>, the paths are generally well-signed and in good condition.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Shared path adjacent to Airport Drive looking south, Melbourne Airport](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7844/45759449634_b0274afe2e_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45759449634/in/album-72157704993851125/)</figure>\n<p>The easiest way to access the beginning of the route is to use <a href=\"https://www.opencyclemap.org/?zoom=15&amp;lat=-37.70975&amp;lon=144.8637&amp;layers=B0000\">the shared path</a> heading north-west along Steele Creek from the M80/Ring Road Trail in Tullamarine. You can then either try cycling down Sharps Road and Keilor Park Drive (not recommended) or take some side streets (Tullamarine Park Road and Assembly Drive) to the intersection of Sharps Road and Airport Drive. Following this shared path along Airport Drive will take you right into the Airport</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"route-3--via-melrose-drive\">Route 3 – via Melrose Drive</h3>\n\n<p>If you are a confident on-road cyclist and want the most direct route to the Airport from the CBD, then Melrose Drive is a third option to consider. I did not try this entire route by myself as I don’t fancy trying to ride down most of the arterial roads that this would involve. But if you are willing to give it a try, it is theoretically possible.</p>\n\n<p>From the city, you can ride along these roads (in sequential order from south to north):</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Elizabeth Street</li>\n  <li>Flemington Road</li>\n  <li>Mount Alexander Road</li>\n  <li>Keilor Road</li>\n  <li>Matthews Avenue</li>\n  <li>Melrose Drive</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Here is <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2HoWXAr\">a map</a> for those who are interested)</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"bicycle-facilities\">Bicycle facilities</h3>\n\n<p>As for bicycle facilities at the Airport, there are very few.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.melbourneairport.com.au/Passengers/Parking/Parking-information/Bicycle-motorcycle-parking#\">Melbourne Airport website</a> describes the bike parking location as ‘on the ground floor of the T1/T2/T3 carpark’. This is not terribly useful as the carpark is huge.</p>\n\n<p>When I arrived, none of the employees that I asked in the carpark had any idea about bicycle parking and there was no signage.</p>\n\n<p>It took me about 20 minutes of cycling randomly around the carpark but I did eventually discover the bike rack. If you are playing at home, it is located on the ground floor just inside one of the entrances to the T1/T2/T3 multi-storey carpark structure directly opposite the terminals.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Melbourne Airport bicycle parking](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7923/46482860971_48ff5d9e46_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/46482860971/in/album-72157704993851125/)</figure>\n<p>I have since <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/6155187141\">added its location to OpenStreetMap</a> so that others can hopefully find it as well.</p>\n\n<p>Have you cycled to Melbourne Airport before?

This has required a whole suite of interesting infrastructure to keep planes, vehicles and pedestrians safe.</p>\n\n<p>There are large orange and white-painted gates on all four sides of the crossing. When aircraft require access to the runway or corporate jet parking, these gates close to allow aeroplanes to move through safely.</p>\n\n<p>Wirraway Road at this point is one lane in each direction with a dividing strip down the middle. There are also footpaths on each side with separate gates for pedestrians.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Gates for aircraft level crossing looking south, Essendon Airport](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7809/32779234408_0c5a8300ef_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/32779234408/in/album-72157705542641414/)</figure>\n<p>It is quite a distance to get across as a pedestrian – about 62 metres.

The most well-known level crossing at an airport in the world is probably the road crossing at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar_International_Airport\">Gibraltar</a> where there is a similar arrangement. This is arguably even more challenging because the road crosses an active runway.</p>\n\n<p>While I was there I did notice that one of the hangars on this side of the Airport was surrounded by construction equipment. According to the signs, a new car dealership is being built there. The <a href=\"https://www.blp.com.au/portfolio/essendonfields/\">2004</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ef.com.au/media-centre/news/essendon-airports-2013-master-plan-approved\">2013</a> Masterplans indicate that the land on which some of the hangars are currently located will be developed. Presumably this will eventually mean less plane traffic across the level crossing.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these changes, it does look like this unique piece of infrastructure is here to stay. The latest 2013 Essendon Fields Masterplan does not seem to suggest that the taxiway will fall out of use or that the corporate jet area will be removed or relocated.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in visiting this site yourself, it is about a 10 minute walk from the route 59 tram terminus or most stops along Matthews Avenue. Several bus routes also run close by.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2019/05/01/melbournes-level-crossing-for-aeroplanes","relative_path":"_posts/2019-05-02-melbournes-level-crossing-for-aeroplanes.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Travel"],"layout":"post","id":2112,"title":"Visit to Milton Keynes","date":"2019-05-15 15:00:16 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2112","tags":["United Kingdom"],"slug":"visit-to-milton-keynes","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p><em>Note: this post was written in August 2017 during my trip to Europe.</em></p>\n","content":"<p><em>Note: this post was written in August 2017 during my trip to Europe.</em></p>\n\n<p>I had planned to do at least one day trip while staying in London.

I eventually settled on Milton Keynes as I could visit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park\">Bletchley Park</a> at the same time and placate my inner history nerd.</p>\n\n<p>The city was built as a masterplanned project in the 1960s as one of the ‘New Towns’ . This was a program designed to accommodate the rapid growth in Greater London. Its modernist design and reuse of the Garden City concept makes it a fascinating place to visit if you are at all interested in urban planning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"first-impressions\">First impressions</h3>\n\n<p>I caught a West Midlands train from Euston Station to get to Milton Keynes. As it was a counter-peak service, the carriages were relatively empty.</p>\n\n<p>Milton Keynes Station is quite a large and imposing complex. It has a massive open plaza out the front which leads to an old bus station and the first of many pedestrian underpasses which I was to encounter.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Milton Keynes Railway Station](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4338/36485143172_e02e95dd48_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36485143172/in/album-72157685309196193/)</figure>\n<p>Even though it was raining and a working day, the entire area was desolate. I spent a good hour or so wandering around on a vague heading towards the massive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Milton_Keynes_shopping_centre\">Central Milton Keynes Shopping Centre</a> buildings seeing hardly any people or activity at all.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Plaza, Milton Keynes](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4400/36515959621_b366491808_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36515959621/in/album-72157685309196193/)</figure>\n<p>It was pretty eerie walking through places that were open and contained all the facilities that anyone could need but without any people in them. Everyone was either driving or not to be seen at all.</p>\n\n<p>As I was to also discover later in Bletchley, the main shopping centre in Milton Keynes had sucked the life out of pretty much any other retail activity in the wider area. Other buildings with shopping areas were either exhibitions of ‘For Lease’ signs or filled with nail salons. massage parlours and discount stores.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-flickr wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-flickr\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">[![Inside shopping arcade, Milton Keynes](https://live.staticflickr.com/4372/36515956591_86015c1696_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36515956591/in/album-72157685309196193/)</div></figure>\n<p>The only place with any decent pedestrian activity was the main shopping centre.

This consisted of a series of plans and architectual drawings from the Milton Keynes Development Corporation showing what the city was supposed to look like.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![History information signs in The Centre, Milton Keynes](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4402/36515950681_f3e6181807_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36515950681/in/album-72157685309196193/)</figure>\n<p>I decided to pick one of the scenes at random and try to find it in the city. The idea was to take a photo from the same place and perspective as the artist’s impression was done.</p>\n\n<p>The location that I ended up choosing was Coopers Mews in Neath Hill. There wasn’t any particular reason for this one other than it looked like a typical suburban scene for an artist’s impression in a new development.</p>\n\n<figure><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d1031.394417942013!2d-0.754196567992381!3d52.0600094134358!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x4877aa8989a28e55%3A0xfe7eaf1fb10f163b!2sCoopers+Mews%2C+Neath+Hill%2C+Milton+Keynes+MK14+6HD%2C+UK!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sau!4v1550652928329\" width=\"600\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Once I had worked out where to go, I set out on my mission.</p>\n\n<p>On my way to Coopers Mews I was able to walk through the famous maze of fully segregated shared pedestrian/cyclist paths and enjoy the scenery.

As artist’s impressions go, the reality wasn’t too far away from what the city’s planners and architects envisaged over 50 years ago.

Others have also written extensively on this important topic.</p>\n\n<p>However, parking at stations covers more than just cars, as accessing public transport by bicycle becomes increasingly popular in parts of Melbourne. <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/more/travelling-on-the-network/bikes-on-public-transport/\">Bicycles are discouraged on trains during peak times</a>, so commuters in particular need somewhere to store their bike while they are work.</p>\n\n<p>The main promotion for encouraging people to ride their bikes to stations involves the well-established Parkiteer program. A partnership between Metro Trains and Bicycle Network has resulted in 106 cages being built at stations across Melbourne and Victoria. There is also one at <a href=\"https://osm.org/go/uG4Yq5U1l?m=\">Doncaster Park and Ride</a> for bus passengers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Parkiteer cage, Hoppers Crossing](https://live.staticflickr.com/7878/33340821698_81782c1e8b_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/33340821698/)</figure>\n<p>Accessing these cages means having a swipe card, obtainable with a $50 bond. Each cage has space for 26 bicycles through a combination of ‘Ned Kelly’ bike racks (requiring bikes to be mounted horizontally) and on-ground hoops. Some cages are larger, such as the one pictured above at Hoppers Crossing.</p>\n\n<p>Other cages began with the standard capacity of 26 but have since been expanded to manage <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/danielbowen/33798723918/\">rapidly increasing demand</a>. The cage at Williams Landing <a href=\"http://www.jillhennessy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MR-Bigger-Better-Bike-Cage-at-Williams-Landing-Station.pdf\">was upgraded to fit a total of 48 bikes in 2015</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The latest figure from 2015 was that over 9,000 people were registered to use Parkiteer cages. Unfortunately, usage data is not publicly available so it is not possible to know how many of these people are actually using the service.</p>\n\n<p>While Parkiteer gets a lot of publicity and promotion, this is not what the vast majority of bike riders use.</p>\n\n<p>If you ride to the station, you are probably more likely to use a public bicycle hoop to lock your bike. These public hoops are often full to overflowing, which means that many resort to using a nearby pole or fence.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Overflow bicycle parking, Nunawading Station](https://live.staticflickr.com/843/42991569902_a94817d55d_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/42991569902/)</figure>\n<p>Why is this so?</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://transport.vic.gov.au/about/data-and-research\">latest station access data</a>, 5,139 people used a bicycle to get to and from a station each weekday (1.1% of all entries). Given that this data comes from 2013-14, I would be willing to bet that this figure is now much higher. This would be due to the <a href=\"https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/traffic-and-road-use/road-network-and-performance/road-use-and-performance\">increases in bicycle usage</a> in Melbourne over the past few years and the expansion of Parkiteer cages across the Victorian rail network.</p>\n\n<p>While we are nowhere near the levels of train-bike interchange seen in countries like the Netherlands, there is still significant demand for people to ride their bicycle to and from stations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Bicycle parking at Amsterdam Central Station](https://live.staticflickr.com/4329/35124445274_038794286c_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/35124445274/)</figure>\n","url":"/blog/2019/07/24/bicycle-parking-at-melbournes-railway-stations","relative_path":"_posts/2019-07-25-bicycle-parking-at-melbournes-railway-stations.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["History"],"layout":"post","id":2273,"title":"What happened to the closed schools of the 1990s?

Instead, I had a look at a map and found Lake Iseo not too far away to the east as an alternative – and it turned out to be a good decision!</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"getting-there\">Getting there</h3>\n\n<p>Despite its distance from the centre of Bergamo, the lake is quite easy to reach. There are two practical options.</p>\n\n<p>You can catch a train from Bergamo Railway Station and interchange to reach the towns of Sarnico or Iseo. Both stations are near the lake’s edge.</p>\n\n<p>I elected to take the other option – a public regional bus service that runs to 30-60 minute frequencies throughout the day. Mystifyingly, the last service departs Sarnico at 6:31pm on a weekday. This is also in August, during the height of the tourist season. There might be a good reason, but it is certainly lost on me.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Bergamo Bus Station](https://live.staticflickr.com/4356/36733859596_9a07e3ff1f_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36733859596/in/album-72157688030019385/)</figure>\n<p>Other than the poor frequency and span of service hours, it was a pleasant 50 minute journey through the more-or-less contiguous urban corridor that runs all the way to Sarnico. I got chatting with the only other passenger on the bus who turned out to be from Israel but living in Milan on a working holiday.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"hike-up-the-mountains\">Hike up the mountains</h3>\n\n<p>The first thing that strikes you about the lake is how everything is so picturesque and perfectly-proportioned; you could hardly imagine a more photogenic scene. Groups of small boats are tied up together, forests run right down to the lake’s edge and small villages and towns are dotted right around the water. It all forms a very nice and welcoming view.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Panorama of Lake Iseo from Sarnico, Italy](https://live.staticflickr.com/4425/36002336343_bb32b131b9_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36002336343/in/album-72157685684428703/)</figure>\n<p>Impressed by this scenery, I consulted my map and found that there were numerous hiking tracks leading to some peaks near Sarnico. I spotted a local bakery and bought some lunch to eat later.</p>\n\n<p>The 33-degree heat rather put me off climbing the 1,400 metre peak of Monte Canzano, so I chose Il Colle to climb instead. At 490 metres in height, it seemed high enough to provide excellent views without needing to kill myself with dehydration.</p>\n\n<p>This required finding the start of the path in the labyrinth of streets north of the town centre. The slope is incredibly steep and there are dangerous combinations of blind corners and no footpaths which made me more than slightly anxious.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Street in Sarnico's upper suburbs, Italy](https://live.staticflickr.com/4432/36002342343_d6f8b80985_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36002342343/in/album-72157685684428703/)</figure>\n<p>After going down a few dead ends and getting strange looks from locals, the path finally came into view. It was made up of rough rocks along most of the route which was not an easy surface on which to walk. But the local municipality had thoughtfully put some benches along the way which helped to ease the foot pain.</p>\n\n<p>I never made it to the very top as the actual peak is in somebody’s backyard. But I did get as close as was possible without being arrested and the views were well worth every jagged stone and swatted fly.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![View of Sarnico, Italy](https://live.staticflickr.com/4407/36811504445_42acf14832_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36811504445/in/album-72157685684428703/)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"finding-the-shore\">Finding the shore</h3>\n\n<p>On my way back down, I ran into the Israeli man who I met on the bus and was able to help him with directions to the path in the other direction (another plug for Maps.me).

Other than some more logically placed trees (they were almost all on the wrong side of the benches to provide shade), it was very nicely done.</p>\n\n<p>The scenery here was no less spectacular than from on high. There were many more birds than I had yet seen in Europe; almost entirely white swans, eurasian coots and other waterbirds. Standing by the side of the main bridge also gives you a great view into the clear waters of the Oglio River and its marine life.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Promenade and riverside gelataria, Sarnico](https://live.staticflickr.com/4418/36811501295_35cf69bc29_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36811501295/in/album-72157685684428703/)</figure>\n<p>Crossing the bridge into Sarnico’s sister town of Paratico is also well worth the walk. The promenade continues around the lakeside and includes several small beaches and swimming areas. For birders, there is a large wetland area just outside the town’s boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>The promenade here seems to have been converted from old industrial railyards. They have kept the tracks in the ground and some of the industrial cranes at two small piers that lead into the lake, presumably once used for loading and unloading goods onto boats. Lots of plants and public artworks have been installed which makes the whole area a very nice place in which to walk.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![New park on disused railway, Paratico](https://live.staticflickr.com/4371/36671926551_dc2a69d7ab_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/36671926551/in/album-72157685684428703/)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n\n<p>I can highly recommend a visit to the area if you are anywhere nearby. Choosing Lake Iseo over the more popular Lake Como was a good decision in hindsight. There were some tourists but nowhere near approaching levels where it would be overcrowded. They were also entirely focussed on the area directly adjacent to the lake in Sarnico and Paratico.

Many of the examples of this brief but fascinating time in design have been lost to the winds of time.</p>\n\n<p>One of the lingering and somewhat surprising artefacts from this period is the famous rocket-shaped tower located at <a href=\"https://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/recreation-arts/parks-and-gardens/central-gardens\">Central Gardens in Hawthorn</a>. Many would remember clambouring up the metal ladders as a child at birthday parties and family gatherings, even in the heat of summer when your hands would practically burn from holding onto the metal railings.</p>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!4v1566899387507!6m8!1m7!1s-9cfECu-iadxOjlZDPshUA!2m2!1d-37.82123800250523!2d145.0426489287685!3f287.50890788361215!4f9.873131915619354!5f0.8642429574936059\" style=\"border:0;\" width=\"600\"></iframe>\n<p>The rocket has been cited in several reports and heritage studies, including <a href=\"https://www.heritage.vic.gov.au/research-and-publications/thematic-and-typological-studies/survey-of-post-war-built-heritage-in-victoria-stage-one\">this 2008-2009 document</a> documenting some of Melbourne’s post-war heritage.</p>\n\n<p>I had no idea about the rocket’s connection with Googie architecture until recently. When I mentioned it to my parents in passing, they talked about another rocket that they remembered playing in when they were children at <a href=\"https://www.foresthillchase.com.au/whats-on/news/explore-the-history-of-the-forest-the-rocket\">Forest Hill Chase Shopping Centre</a> (now at <a href=\"https://au.blurb.com/b?ebook=416896\">Syndal South Primary School</a>). This got me thinking about how many others were constructed.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that quite a few of these rockets were built and many remain. While the one in Hawthorn is probably the best-known in Melbourne, there is also one located in <a href=\"http://www.benalla.vic.gov.au/Your-Council/Major-Projects/Adventure-Park\">Benalla at the Adventure Park</a> (built 1966).</p>\n\n<p>But as far as I can tell, these are only the ones that remain today. There is not much information that I can find, but from the snippets and random pieces out there it is clear that there may have been many more.</p>\n\n<p>The park outside the public housing commission towers (Park Towers) in South Melbourne used to contain a similar rocket. This is recalled by artist <a href=\"http://www.langford120.com.au/e18-george-m.html\">George Matoulas</a> who grew up there and is also shown in <a href=\"http://search.slv.vic.gov.au/permalink/f/1cl35st/SLV_VOYAGER2851931\">this photo</a> taken in c1969 from urban photographer Alan K. Jordan.</p>\n\n<p>On a related note, the South Melbourne Library currently has a <a href=\"https://heritage.portphillip.vic.gov.au/Whats_on/Events_Calendar/Exhibition_-_Monument_to_a_view_Park_Towers_1969_-_2019\">terrific exhibition</a> on Park Towers showing until 27 September that I can highly recommend.</p>\n\n<p>New South Wales seems to have preserved more of these than Victoria, and may have had more installed in the first place. Sydney has a few remaining at parks in <a href=\"https://busycitykids.com.au/our-blog/2017/1/15/muston-park-chatswood-sydney\">Chatswood</a> and <a href=\"https://roamthegnome.com/enmore-park-marrickville/\">Marrickville</a>, with several also in <a href=\"https://centralcoast.kidsizeliving.com.au/content/lions-park\">towns</a> across the state (funnily enough most descriptions of these parks all have the word ‘iconic’ in them).</p>\n\n<p>There’s this great series of photos from one located in Mittagong, showing its <a href=\"https://www.southernhighlandnews.com.au/story/5378980/mittagong-rocket-lands-in-winifred-west-park-playground-in-1968/\">original delivery</a> and installation in 1968. It must have been quite an event at the time.</p>\n\n<p>It is also interesting to note that these Australian rockets appear to have been inspired (or copied, depending on your point of view) by American examples. Examples still exist in many towns and cities across the United States, including <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/7776581@N04/4936812172\">Huchinson (Minnesotta)</a>, <a href=\"https://boulderrealestatenews.com/scott-carpenter-park-summertime/scott-carpenter-park-c/\">Boulder (Colorado)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/63894888438359995/\">Kalamazoo (Michigan)</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Rocket Park, Missouri](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Rocket_Park%2C_Missouri.jpg/512px-Rocket_Park%2C_Missouri.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rocket_Park,_Missouri.jpg)<figcaption>A rocket park in Missouri (Paul Sableman \\[[CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)\\], [via Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rocket_Park,_Missouri.jpg))</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Do you remember any rockets that I’ve missed here, or know other information about their design, placement and manufacture?

The ones that I went to visit, Rubicon, Royston and Rubicon Falls, are a little more obscure.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll be covering more details about the history of the Scheme in a future post. This one will cover my hike and provide tips and details of the trip.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"getting-there\">Getting there</h3>\n\n<p>Despite my best attempts to plan, the Rubicon Valley is not accessible by public transport. The <a href=\"https://classic.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/view/1935/\">684 bus</a> passes along the Maroondah Highway and gets you reasonably close, but the nearest stop in Taggerty is over <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/acF7jpeheo3BghZMA\">18 kilometres away</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The drive is pleasant, particularly once you get out of the Black Spur just east of Healesville on the Maroondah Highway. The Spur is beautiful and scenic, but the hairpin bends and vans speeding around blind corners in the opposite direction do not make it a relaxing drive at all.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive right up to the base of the Valley where the Rubicon Power Station is located. The road from the entrance to the Historic Area is unsealed but of good quality. I drove up to this point in a small hatchback 2WD without any issues at all.</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=145.85255026817325%2C-37.3291333311451%2C145.86454510688785%2C-37.32298208589065&amp;layer=mapnik\" style=\"border: 1px solid black\" width=\"425\"></iframe>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/-37.32606/145.85855\">View Larger Map</a></small>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hiking-the-rubicon-valley\">Hiking the Rubicon Valley</h3>\n\n<p>I hiked a sort of loop that took me past most of the infrastructure with a minimum of doubling back.</p>\n\n<p>[leaflet-map fitbounds]</p>\n\n<p>[leaflet-gpx src=https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rubicon.gpx color=black]</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>One thing that guides and many other websites fail to mention is the access arrangements for some of the areas. A couple of tracks are restricted during certain times of the year.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Sign explaining seasonal track closures in Rubicon Valley Historic Area](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48803006232_b26f5e8a34_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48803006232/in/album-72157711083607877/)</figure>\n<p>Neither the sign nor the Parks Victoria website were clear as to whether this closure refers to vehicles only or to all public traffic. Given that the references on the sign are to “driver safety” and “Four Wheel Drive Clubs”, I took this to mean that it applied only to vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>There are some other tracks that are restricted by AGL or logging companies as well. Again, there were many areas that were unclear as to whether or not public access is actually permitted – such as a large gate being across a path entrance but no sign saying that access is prohibited (which were in other areas). I erred on the side of caution with these particular examples and stayed out.</p>\n\n<p>All up, I think AGL, Parks Victoria and the other authorities responsible for access in this area need better signage to clarify this.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Gate on No 6 Track, Rubicon Valley](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48802862796_877df02bf9_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48802862796/in/album-72157711083607877/)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>Given that I had selected a public holiday, I wasn’t expecting much company at all. To my surprise, as I approached the base of the mountain range, I saw tens of tents at all of the campsites near the forest. Turns out that it’s quite a popular camping and 4WD activity area.</p>\n\n<p>I headed up Royston Road for my first leg. The first part is quite steep but not too bad. The track is well graded and wide, with only the occassional logging truck or 4WD going by to contend with in terms of traffic.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Logging truck on Royston Road, Rubicon Valley](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48803004622_496420fd80_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48803004622/in/album-72157711083607877/)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>Unfortunately you can’t see very much of the Royston River – the road is quite a bit higher up the side of the valley. The only point where you can get a good look is at the 3 Kilometre Bridge.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Royston River from 3km Bridge, Rubicon Valley](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48802511863_a4511ddb2d_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48802511863/in/album-72157711083607877/)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>As a bonus, just past this point is where the road begins to turn and creates some good vantage points through the trees to see the view back towards Alexandra.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![View looking north down the Rubicon Valley towards Alexandra](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48802861011_23cc7f2ae6_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48802861011/in/album-72157711083607877/)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>As the earlier truck indicated, there is a large section of former bushland just east of the Rubicon Valley which has been logged extensively over the past few months. Some of the tracks leading in that direction have been shut to the public for this reason.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Entrance to logging areas in Rubicon Valley](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48802510328_71cc20c590_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48802510328/in/album-72157711083607877/)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>Once you start to reach the top of the hill, the trees open up on the left and huge areas of former bushland come into view. Freshly-felled trees can be seen littered around the nearby hillsides for as far as the eye can see.</p>\n\n<p>This particular site has been the site of ongoing <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/sustainability/a-ray-of-hope-in-the-fight-against-unsustainable-logging-20180511-p4zeqd.html\">protests</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rubiconforest.org/\">campaigns</a> in an attempt to stop logging operations in the area – it seems that they have been unsuccessful.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Logged forest near Rubicon Valley](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48802855716_1ba45bc508_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48802855716/in/album-72157711083607877/)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>The landscape at the top of the hill near Royston Power Station is noticeably different to that at the bottom. I’m no ecologist or environmental scientist, but my guess is the 500-600 metre difference in altitude. The ground vegetation here is less dense and there are large rocks with beautiful shapes and colours scattered throughout.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Rock formation next to Royston River Road, Rubicon Valley](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48802509038_443050e54b_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48802509038/in/album-72157711083607877/)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>I finally reached the Royston Power Station, complete with its rebuilt wooden tramway bridge and almost fully intact tracks.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Royston Power Station and tramway bridge, Rubicon Valley](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48802852961_9b1fdaf017_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48802852961/in/album-72157711083607877/)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>Just around the corner is a small collection of buildings called the Royston Oustation. This includes the Rubicon School Camp and a run-down depot shed for the SEC tramway that follows the acqueduct all the way back to the Rubicon Power Station.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Royston Outstation buildings, Rubicon Valley](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48802503668_e4aa9af605_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48802503668/in/album-72157711083607877/)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>I’ll save the details of this area and the historic sites on my way back down the Valley for my next post about the Hydroelectric Scheme, but suffice to say that it’s very pleasant to wander through this beautiful bushland and stumble across such a large number of intact and historically significant sites.</p>\n\n<p>One spot that is definitely worth a stop is the Rubicon Falls. It is just upriver from the Rubicon Dam and hard to miss on account of the roar that you can hear from a good 800 metres away.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Rubicon Falls 2, Rubicon Valley](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48802498303_ac929d4a55_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48802498303/in/album-72157711083607877/)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>By this point, the wind had started to pick up and there was lots of unnerving creaking coming from the upper reaches of the tree canopy. However, because of the wind’s direction and the alignment of the Valley, there was hardly any wind at ground level.</p>\n\n<p>Getting closer to where I began, the road falls down to river level and follows it directly above or next to its eastern bank.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![Rubicon River rapids](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48803011797_3b9e47cd75_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48803011797/in/album-72157711083607877/)</figure>\n<p>Just before reaching the end of the circuit and the Rubicon Power Station, there is a small path that will take you a little further up the hill towards the end of the SEC tramway and aqueduct. It’s well worth the extra climb as you can get a great view of the valley looking north.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">[![View looking north from bottom of pipe to Rubicon Power Station, Rubicon Valley](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48802522123_5ab896b800_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48802522123/in/album-72157711083607877/)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>Even if you are not interested at all in power generation or the history of the area, the Valley and its surrounds are still worth the trip. There doesn’t appear to be that much wildlife, but the scenery is beautiful – the two rivers in particular are something that you don’t get to experience on most hikes.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in the areas history, my next post will go into more detail on this aspect of my hike – so stay tuned!

I’ll do another post on that should it come up.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"some-brief-observations\">Some brief observations</h3>\n\n<p>I’ll do some more detailed posts soon on the data. For now, here are some notes from a quick glance.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, patronage has continued to increase – from 229.4 million trips in 2017-18 to 231.6 million trips in 2018-19.</p>\n\n<p>This data also includes all Mernda Extension stations and, for the first time, stations on the Flemington Racecourse Line.</p>\n\n<p>There are some interesting rises and falls by station:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Southern Cross</strong> has continued its long-term trend of increasing patronage (5.0% – or around 938,000 extra trips annually). For comparison, <strong>Flinders Street’s</strong> patronage increased by 0.6% (or about 160,000 trips annually).</li>\n  <li><strong>Melbourne Central</strong> has seen a notable decline in the number of passengers (-3.83% or 608,000 trips annually). My guess is that this might be due to the large number of disruptions resulting in trains being directed out of the City Loop in 2018-19. This might have resulted in more passengers using Southern Cross instead.</li>\n  <li><strong>South Morang</strong> has seen a decrease of 30.0% (or around 380,000 trips annually). This is probably due to the Mernda Extension opening and associated construction impacts. People who previously had to travel to South Morang to catch a train can now access one of the three new stations that would be closer to their home.</li>\n  <li><strong>Rosanna, Hughesdale and Southland</strong> all had the three highest increases in patronage. However, the first two were disrupted for long periods due to level crossing removal projects, and Southland opened part way through 2017-18, so these are not typical comparisons.</li>\n  <li>The biggest surprise to me is that <strong>Crib Point</strong> comes out as having the highest percentage increase of passengers of 43.3% (excluding the three stations mentioned above). Admittedly, these are low numbers – an increase from 12,496 in 2017-18 to 17,911 in 2018-19. Not sure why this might be the case.</li>\n  <li><strong>Officer</strong> continues its trend of huge increases in patronage, which increased by 31.7% in 2018-19. This is almost certainly due to the large-scale urban sprawl in the area. For the first time, it has cracked 100,000 annual trips. Just four years ago in 2015-16, Officer’s annual patronage was 60,256. In 2018-19, it has more than doubled to 122,892.</li>\n  <li><strong>Carrum</strong> has seen the greatest decrease in patronage of 31.7%. No surprises here, given that it was disrupted for long periods in early 2019 due to level crossing removal works. As of 9 July 2019 (outside of these statistics), it has been closed until 2020 to allow the station and its precinct to be rebuilt.</li>\n  <li><strong>Westona</strong> has the most stable patronage as a percentage between 2017-18 and 2018-19 – a difference of only -0.01%. <strong>Morradoo</strong> has the most stable patronage as an absolute number (only 2 fewer people in 2018-19 compared to 2017-18).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-one-million-club\">The One Million Club</h3>\n\n<p>Stations that have annual patronage of one million or more in 2018-19 (in descending order of annual patronage) are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Flinders Street</li>\n  <li>Southern Cross</li>\n  <li>Melbourne Central</li>\n  <li>Parliament</li>\n  <li>Footscray</li>\n  <li>Flagstaff</li>\n  <li>South Yarra</li>\n  <li>Richmond</li>\n  <li>Caulfield</li>\n  <li>Box Hill</li>\n  <li>Glenferrie</li>\n  <li>Dandenong</li>\n  <li>Sunshine</li>\n  <li>Camberwell</li>\n  <li>Ringwood</li>\n  <li>Williams Landing</li>\n  <li>Oakleigh</li>\n  <li>Glen Waverley</li>\n  <li>Watergardens</li>\n  <li>Clayton</li>\n  <li>Huntingdale</li>\n  <li>Springvale</li>\n  <li>North Melbourne</li>\n  <li>Blackburn</li>\n  <li>Essendon</li>\n  <li>Newport</li>\n  <li>Frankston</li>\n  <li>Hoppers Crossing</li>\n  <li>Mitcham</li>\n  <li>Craigieburn</li>\n  <li>Werribee</li>\n  <li>Laverton</li>\n  <li>Glenroy</li>\n  <li>St Albans</li>\n  <li>Prahran</li>\n  <li>Nunawading</li>\n  <li>Balaclava</li>\n  <li>Jolimont</li>\n</ol>\n","url":"/blog/2019/11/13/station-patronage-in-melbourne-for-2005-2019","relative_path":"_posts/2019-11-14-station-patronage-in-melbourne-for-2005-2019.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["History","Planning"],"layout":"post","id":2420,"title":"Are more people living in apartments now than in 1954?","date":"2019-11-27 14:00:50 -0600","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2420","tags":["Melbourne"],"slug":"are-more-people-living-in-apartments-now-than-in-1954","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>65 years ago the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW) released the Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme.

This is because information is published under different grouped definitions, as explained below.</p>\n\n<p>The 1954 MMBW report has four definitions of housing structure:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Private House</li>\n  <li>Sharing Private House</li>\n  <li>Flats</li>\n  <li>Tenements</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/999DC1D0F455DA6CCA257AF300154D05/$File/13010_1951%20section%2013.pdf\">definitions provided</a> at the time by the Commonwealth Statistician (and noted in the MMBW report) at the time are:</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>“For Census purposes a ” <strong>flat</strong>” is defined as part of a house or other building ordinarily intended for occupation by a separate family group, and is a self-contained dwelling unit with both cooking and bathing facilities.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>A ” <strong>tenement</strong> ” is part of a house or other building ordinarily intended for occupation by a separate family group but is not a self-contained unit, and consists in the main of a room or room with cooking facilities.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In the case of the remaining private houses shared by more than one family, separate schedules were furnished for each portion occupied separately and these portions are shown in the tables as separate dwellings under the heading “<strong>Share of Private House</strong>“.”</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>In comparison, the 2016 Census definitions focus entirely on the physical structure of the dwelling rather than any sort of living arrangements (now categorised under ‘Household composition’).</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, I think that only two overarching categories can be used to fairly compare these two sets of data:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Separate house</li>\n  <li>Flat or apartment</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The first category includes the following 2016 dwelling structures:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Separate house</li>\n  <li>Semi-detached, row or terrace house, townhouse etc. with one storey</li>\n  <li>Semi-detached, row or terrace house, townhouse etc. with two or more storeys</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The second category includes the following 2016 structures:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Flat or apartment in a one or two storey block</li>\n  <li>Flat or apartment in a three storey block</li>\n  <li>Flat or apartment in a four or more storey block</li>\n  <li>Flat or apartment attached to a house</li>\n  <li>House or flat attached to a shop, office, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bringing that all together, this is the comparison that we get (2016 data from ABS Tablebuilder):</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/apartments.png)</figure>\n<p>In summary, the percentage of apartments of total dwellings in Melbourne has increased by 66 percent between 1954 and 2016.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not as drastic a change as I originally suspected and it would be interesting to track the trend over time from Census and other information.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"additional-notes\"><strong>Additional note</strong>s</h3>\n\n<p>The MMBW repeats the findings of the <a href=\"https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-851519579/view?partId=nla.obj-851583656\">1944 Commonwealth Housing Commission report</a> on higher-density housing needs and preferences:</p>\n\n<p><em>“The Commission reported that both houses and flats are necessary according to the particular way of life and circumstances of persons to be housed. The persons or families for whom flats or multi-unit dwellings are particularly suited are:</em></p>\n\n<p><em>(a) Single persons who wish to have their own private accommodation as distinct from boarding houses or hostels.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>(b) Married couples without children or perhaps one child who do not wish to garden and require more time to pursue other interests.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>(c) Persons of either the circumstances set out in (a) and (b) who are employed in occupations which require periodic transfer such as railway and postal workers, teachers, service people and bank clerks,</em></p>\n\n<p><em>(d) Some middle-aged and elderly persons whose families have grown up and who do not desire to continue with a house too large for them and with the responsibility of maintaining grounds.”</em></p>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<p><em>“The rising cost of building private houses and the increasing distance of available new building sites from the city centre are already causing many young people to seek old houses or flats in convenient inner suburbs rather than build new houses in the more distant suburbs.”</em></p>\n\n<p>75 years later, we are still finding exactly the same thing.

It’s the only roundabout that has a tram junction within it.</p>\n\n<p>In 1939, a report was presented and considered by Melbourne City Council on the installation of these newfangled “round-abouts” in areas close to the CBD. The proposal was panned on the basis that it would require extensive and expensive modifications of existing intersections.</p>\n\n<p>Three intersections were proposed as being suitable. The “most ideal” location was at Haymarket, where the large roundabout stands today.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article243142604\">this article from </a><em><a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article243142604\">The Herald</a></em> at the time, the reason for picking this particular spot was that trams could be diverted underground to grade seperate them from road traffic.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article243381423\">Haymarket</a> was not selected as the trial site.</p>\n\n<p>However, in 1951, Melbourne City Council <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23068734\">approved plans</a> to construct “Melbourne’s first” roundabout (a title claimed by several others, and the subject of a future post) at Haymarket. There was <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article245035677\">a lot of confusion</a> over the road rules for the behaviour of vehicles in this new “whirligig” intersection which took some time to iron out.</p>\n\n<p>Soon after <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23252571\">its completion</a>, there were <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article205423934\">plans</a> to build a large water feature in the middle, on the basis that “…Melbourne did not have a really satisfactory fountain”.

A ‘bog’ near the main circuit track was completely empty of water and full of dust.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently there are some koalas but I didn’t see any. In fact, the whole area was notably absent of any wildlife other than ants. I saw a couple of ravens and heard one kookaburra. Otherwise there were no other animals to be seen.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/49397546573/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Branding Yard Trail, You Yangs Regional Park\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49397546573_4b19ed03d8_z.jpg\" alt=\"Branding Yard Trail, You Yangs Regional Park\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>It’s not a very long or strenuous hike up to the higher areas of the Park. The path network is pretty confusing and it’s easy to get lost. While most of the intersections are at least partially signed, it’s impossible to know which way to go to reach a particular destination (e.g. Flinders Peak) without closely consulting your map.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I eventually made it up to the carpark and base of the steps up to the Peak. The views from here are unrestricted in almost any direction. On a clear day, you would be able to see the Dandenongs.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/49398241202/in/datetaken/\" title=\"View looking west from You Yangs Regional Park\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49398241202_938400c804_z.jpg\" alt=\"View looking west from You Yangs Regional Park\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/49397549128/in/datetaken/\" title=\"Mornington Peninsula from You Yangs Regional Park\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49397549128_e1829e3d4a_z.jpg\" alt=\"Mornington Peninsula from You Yangs Regional Park\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>I made my way back the same way. Because only every second train stops at Little River at interpeak times on a weekday, headways are 40 minutes at Little River instead of 20 minutes at nearby Lara. As a result, a little planning is required on the return trip.

The link to the query that I used is <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/tcoalpl\">here</a> if anyone else is interested.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"results\">Results</h3>\n\n<p>There are a few possible answers to this question.</p>\n\n<p>Whether a suburb is officially considered ‘part of Melbourne’ is not an easy question to answer. Some definitions are for Greater Melbourne, which includes a lot of non-urban land, while others will only consider those ‘connected’ to the city with contiguous urban form. As a result, I’m providing a couple of answers for each scenario.</p>\n\n<p>If you take a strict definition of ‘Greater Melbourne’, as defined by the ABS in its <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1270.0.55.001~July%202016~Main%20Features~Greater%20Capital%20City%20Statistical%20Areas%20(GCCSA)~10003\">Greater Capital City Statistical Areas</a>, then Wesburn comes out as the largest suburb with an area of 26,640 ha (266.40 km<sup>2</sup>). However, with a population of only 1,019, it is sparsely inhabited and is a bit of a stretch to consider this as a ‘suburb’.</p>\n\n<p>A better definition for this question is for Metropolitan Melbourne – which I would consider a settlement that is directly ‘connected’ to the rest of the city with some sort of built form.</p>\n\n<p>Using this option, Pakenham takes out the title of largest suburb in Melbourne at 8,647 ha (86.47 km2). It’s important to note that a large portion of the suburb is not built up (yet).</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=145.35306930541995%2C-38.132261159460185%2C145.57966232299808%2C-38.009959746807006&amp;layer=mapnik\" style=\"border: 1px solid black\" width=\"425\"></iframe>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-38.0711/145.4664\">View Larger Map</a></small>While Sunbury is at the end of a metropolitan railway and technically larger than Pakenham (13,219ha), there is a large gap of undeveloped land between it and the rest of Melbourne.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in exploring the data yourself, you can download the spreadsheet <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Suburb-areas.csv\">here</a>.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2020/04/15/which-is-the-largest-suburb-in-melbourne","relative_path":"_posts/2020-04-16-which-is-the-largest-suburb-in-melbourne.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Cycling"],"layout":"post","id":2602,"title":"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on cycling in Melbourne &#8211; a first glance","date":"2020-05-04 15:30:00 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2602","tags":["Data"],"slug":"impact-of-covid-19-lockdown-on-cycling-in-melbourne-first-glance","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>Anyone who has been out on Melbourne’s street network or shared paths will have witnessed the explosion in the number of people walking and cycling.

Every counter has broken at least one previous record. Even routes used primarily by commuters – like the St Georges Road Path – has seen more riders than ever before (albeit on weekends).</p>\n\n<p>These are the largest increases since this dataset began five years ago in 2015.</p>\n\n<p>I have not yet had a chance to go through all 47 sites in great detail, but at a glance the highest increases in volumes appear to be at:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Darebin Creek Trail (at Heidelberg Road)</li>\n  <li>Bay Trail (St Kilda)</li>\n  <li>Anniversary Trail (Balwyn)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I will hopefully have the time soon to do some more detailed analysis and present these findings in another post. The full data is fiddly to use as the numbers are spread out across different spreadsheets covering individual days and counters, so it’s a bit of work to get any meaninful information.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, a more readable data summary should be released on the VicRoads dashboard soon.

There are some stops with more obscure references:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/stop/3136/racing-victoria161-epsom-rd-31/1/tram/\">Racing Victoria/161 Epsom Road (Flemington)</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/stop/2442/qpocotham-rd-34/1/tram/\">QPO/Cotham Road (Kew)</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While most stops that are located close or adjacent to railway stations are labelled accordingly (e.g. ‘Elsternwick Station’), this one is not for some reason:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/stop/2341/orrong-rdmalvern-rd-37/1/tram/\">Orrong Road/Malvern Road</a> (next to Toorak Station)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There’s also this curious phenomenon when the PTV website and timetables don’t quite match up with physical signs at tram stops:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>‘<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/vPAdc1Hu5BEn1Msg9\">Hawthorn Station</a>‘ vs. ‘<a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/stop/3008/hawthorn-stationburwood-rd-26/1/tram/\">Hawthorn Railway Station</a>‘</li>\n  <li>‘<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/ES7yEyeNi5sx4N7j9\">Kooyong Station</a>‘ vs. ‘<a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/stop/2911/kooyong-stationglenferrie-rd-65/1/tram/\">Kooyong Railway Station</a>‘</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most confusing of all are those stops that have a twin nearby:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/6hvGd9vSchdfBbmC9\">Highpoint Shopping Centre (stop 49)</a> and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/xW3dzVUyBc5vNYdq7\">Highpoint Shopping Centre (Stop 51)</a> (this one is particularly confusing because the PTV website/timetable doesn’t match with the stop’s physical signage, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/kzLybcio8KLScuSb8\">which you can see here</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This stop is called ‘Kew Cemetery’ even though the main entrance is actually at the next tram stop, 250 metres up the road. It also shows the perils of naming things after facilities, as its official name is now technically ‘<a href=\"http://kewcemetery.com.au/\">Boroondara General Cemetery</a>‘:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/stop/2259/kew-cemeteryhigh-st-37/1/tram/\">Kew Cemetery/High St (Kew)</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These two stops are on the wrong sides of the road from the things that they are named after (literally all they’d have to do is swap them):</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/stop/2913/vision-australia454-glenferrie-rd-66/1/\">Vision Australia/454 Glenferrie Road</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/stop/2914/kooyong-tennis-centreglenferrie-rd-66/1/tram/\">Kooyong Tennis Centre/Glenferrie Road</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, this one isn’t really that strange but I do love the idea of the tram stop being named after a children’s’ traffic school.

Here are six of these that I think are among the most commonly ignored or misunderstood.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"1-you-dont-always-have-to-cross-a-street-at-a-designated-pedestrian-crossing\">1. You don’t always have to cross a street at a designated pedestrian crossing</h3>\n\n<p>Many people seem to think that it is not legal to cross a road or street except at a designated crossing. This is most definitely not the case in Victoria.</p>\n\n<p>You are able to cross a road or street where there is no designated crossing, so long as you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Are not within 20 metres of a designated pedestrian crossing</li>\n  <li>Are not crossing against a sign that prohibits pedestrians</li>\n  <li>Use the shortest and most direct route to cross</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a few other more specific requirements for crossing that you can read <a href=\"https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/safety-and-road-rules/road-rules/a-to-z-of-road-rules/pedestrians\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A good way to work out the 20 metre distance is to visualise a <a href=\"https://vicsig.net/trams/class/D1\">D1-class tram</a>, which is almost exactly 20 metres long.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/volvob12b/21123049648/\" title=\"D-class Melbourne tram.\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/706/21123049648_42c13bf438_z.jpg\" alt=\"D-class Melbourne tram.\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>If you are interested in the details, there are many people who have already detailed the history of jaywalking and its invention (examples <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2012/04/invention-jaywalking/1837/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"2-vehicles-must-not-turn-across-tram-tracks-bounded-by-double-yellow-lines-or-raised-dividers\">2. Vehicles must not turn across tram tracks bounded by double yellow lines or raised dividers</h3>\n\n<p>This one is dedicated to my fellow passengers on the route 48 tram travelling down Bridge Road.</p>\n\n<p>With the largest tram network in the world, Melbourne has many locations where “tramways” have been installed and designated. These are marked by either double yellow lines or raised divider strips.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/14192031318/\" title=\"New tram lane dividers on Collins St\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/2933/14192031318_bfb39934d9_z.jpg\" alt=\"New tram lane dividers on Collins St\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>Back to the 48 tram, most times that I travel along Bridge Road there is at least one motorist who drives in front of the tram over these dividers causing either <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20151007070330/http://tramsimulator.com.au/\">vigorous dinging</a> or emergency braking (or both).</p>\n\n<p>RIP the front cabins of C-class trams…</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"3-vehicles-must-give-way-to-pedestrians-crossing-in-a-slip-lane\">3. Vehicles must give way to pedestrians crossing in a slip lane</h3>\n\n<p>I would nominate this one for the prize of least-followed road rule in Victoria.</p>\n\n<p>If you are driving or riding a vehicle entering any slip lane, you must give way to pedestrians crossing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48393982457/\" title=\"Zebra crossing to nowhere, Bendigo\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48393982457_1f86441866_z.jpg\" alt=\"Zebra crossing to nowhere, Bendigo\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>This rule is probably made confusing by the fact that many slip lanes in Victorian have zebra or other crossings that explicitly give the right of way to people walking, wheeling or riding across the road. This may lead people to believe that they do not have to give way at other slip lanes where there are no markings.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"4-vehicles-must-give-way-to-turning-buses\">4. Vehicles must give way to turning buses</h3>\n\n<p>As I dedicated a previous section to my fellow 48 tram passengers, I will refer in this one to those who also frequent the 200/207 bus down Johnston Street.</p>\n\n<p>In short, if you are in a built-up area and a bus is turning out from the kerb (e.g. from a bus stop), you must give way. Even if it is an indented kerb.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48849808487/in/album-72157687819963374/\" title=\"246 bus waiting at Clifton Hill Station bus stop\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48849808487_45f4399075_z.jpg\" alt=\"246 bus waiting at Clifton Hill Station bus stop\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>This is regardless of whether they are turning into a bus lane or not. If you see a bus by the side of the road, keep an eye out for its indicator.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"5-dont-park-close-to-bus-stops\">5. Don’t park close to bus stops.</h3>\n\n<p>Unless otherwise signed, you are not permitted to park, stop or leave your vehicle within 20 metres on the approach or 10 metres on the departure side of any public bus stop.</p>\n\n<p>This is to allow sufficient space for a bus to enter and exit the bus stop safely and pull up to the kerb. This is especially important if the ramp needs to be used for people in wheelchairs, elderly people or others who require this service.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/33976721208/\" title=\"Car parked in bus stop, Sydney\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33976721208_9a041317ed_z.jpg\" alt=\"Car parked in bus stop, Sydney\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>As noted above, there may be parking or other regulatory signs that override this rule. In this case, you can safely park or stop there within the parameters set by any other signage and regulations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bonus rule:</strong> don’t park, stop or leave your vehicle in a bus zone unless you are driving a public bus. This does <strong>not</strong> include coaches, taxis, rideshare vehicles, etc.</p>\n\n<p>As a sidenote, <a href=\"https://getinvolved.transport.vic.gov.au/commercial-passenger-vehicle-regulations/widgets/193937/faqs\">as of last year</a>, taxis and rideshare vehicles are allowed to stop in a bus lane if picking up or dropping off passengers, but this does not apply to bus zones.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2020/06/24/six-least-understood-victorian-road-rules","relative_path":"_posts/2020-06-25-six-least-understood-victorian-road-rules.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport"],"layout":"post","id":2770,"title":"Where are the busiest bus stops in Melbourne?","date":"2020-07-23 20:36:09 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2770","header_position":["inherit"],"header_fullwidth":["inherit"],"page_header_styling":["inherit"],"heading_title":["0"],"custom_logo":[""],"custom_logo_width":[""],"custom_menu_skin":["default"],"sticky_menu_on_page":["default"],"custom_sticky_logo":[""],"sticky_menu_skin":["default"],"section_logo_switch":["0"],"footer_visibility":["inherit"],"fixed_footer":["inherit"],"footer_fullwidth":["inherit"],"featured_image_placing":["default"],"post_image_size":["inherit"],"page_custom_css":[""],"slide_template":["default"],"rs_page_bg_color":["#ffffff"],"tags":["Bus data"],"slug":"where-are-the-busiest-bus-stops-in-melbourne","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p><em><strong>Update 3:25pm 24/07/2020:</strong> It’s been brought to my attention that some of the figures below are incorrect due to an error with amalgamating patronage data from multiple stops.

The basic problem is that if I cast the geofence wider, it catches stops that aren’t related to each other. If I use stop names to join stops instead, it also catches stops that shouldn’t be grouped. For now, <strong>please assume that the numbers below are rough guides only and almost certainly exclude some nearby stops</strong>.</em></p>\n\n<p>Last year I obtained bus stop patronage data for 2018-19 from the Department of Transport and displayed it on <a href=\"https://maps.philipmallis.com/victorian-bus-stop-patronage/\">this interactive map</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philipmallis/status/1240157985931808768\" title=\"https://twitter.com/philipmallis/status/1240157985931808768\">already briefly looked</a> at the least used bus stops in this dataset, with 2,044 recording one or fewer average daily boardings.</p>\n\n<p>But where are the busiest?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/50094964438/\" title=\"Bus running 782 to Balnarring at Frankston Station bus interchange\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50094964438_9e5233ce81_z.jpg\" alt=\"Bus running 782 to Balnarring at Frankston Station bus interchange\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>Before we can answer that, a quick word about the data.</p>\n\n<p>DoT record each bus stop as a separate point on a map rather than grouping them by location or name.</p>\n\n<p>For example, each bay at Chadstone Shopping Centre is mapped as a separate point even though they are all within the same interchange and have the same destination. You can see the result of this on Google Maps which uses a feed from the same GTFS dataset.</p>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" aria-hidden=\"false\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m12!1m3!1d468.0747797427934!2d145.08356315815843!3d-37.8879098900762!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sau!4v1595548954305!5m2!1sen!2sau\" style=\"border:0;\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"600\"></iframe>\n<hr />\n\n<p>So to get a decent answer to this question we have to group like stops together.</p>\n\n<p>For the purposes of the map above, I did this based on name and a geofence around the central point of the interchange. It’s probably not perfect but I think good enough for this project. <strong>As noted in the update above, after I wrote this post it’s been pointed out to me that the numbers below are quite a bit off. So please take these results with a grain of salt until a solution can be found.</strong></p>\n\n<p>To start with, let’s see which stops have 1,000 or more average boardings per day.</p>\n\n<div class=\"tableauPlaceholder\" id=\"viz1595554486655\" style=\"position: relative\"><noscript>[![ ](https://public.tableau.com/static/images/JQ/JQF9G5FX2/1_rss.png)](https://maps.philipmallis.com/victorian-bus-stop-patronage/)</noscript><object class=\"tableauViz\" style=\"display:none;\"><param name=\"host_url\" value=\"https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F\" />&lt;/param&gt; <param name=\"embed_code_version\" value=\"3\" />&lt;/param&gt; <param name=\"path\" value=\"shared/JQF9G5FX2\" />&lt;/param&gt; <param name=\"toolbar\" value=\"yes\" />&lt;/param&gt;<param name=\"static_image\" value=\"https://public.tableau.com/static/images/JQ/JQF9G5FX2/1.png\" />&lt;/param&gt; <param name=\"animate_transition\" value=\"yes\" />&lt;/param&gt;<param name=\"display_static_image\" value=\"yes\" />&lt;/param&gt;<param name=\"display_spinner\" value=\"yes\" />&lt;/param&gt;<param name=\"display_overlay\" value=\"yes\" />&lt;/param&gt;<param name=\"display_count\" value=\"yes\" />&lt;/param&gt;<param name=\"language\" value=\"en\" />&lt;/param&gt;</object></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1595554486655');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>\n<hr />\n\n<p>I think that this map by itself is fascinating. There are clear patterns for where boardings are high. The Werribee and Dandenong Lines have high boardings in the middle and outer suburbs, showing the high demand for interchanging between rail and bus services.</p>\n\n<p>Although I’m not 100% sure what’s going on with the ‘Hume Anglican Grammar School’ stop in Craigieburn. I suspect that this may be a data error given that one of the default myki touch on locations (for when myki is running in ‘headless mode’ and doesn’t know where it is) is around there. So unless someone familiar with the area can explain this, I’m ignoring it for now.</p>\n\n<p>I won’t go into detailed analysis about the spatial distribution of these stops as I think that deserves a separate post and others would probably do it better.

North Melbourne Station is the anomaly here. Almost all of those boardings would be passengers changing from trains to buses, almost certainly to the University of Melbourne in Parkville.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/49849355461/in/photolist-2iX1YDT-2iX3yKY-2iWYfZm\" title=\"Crowd of people boarding route 733 bus at Monash University, Clayton\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49849355461_7439628ce4_z.jpg\" alt=\"Crowd of people boarding route 733 bus at Monash University, Clayton\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>Most of the other 90 stops are associated with railway stations, reinforcing the important role that buses play in the rail network. Given that the latest data that we have on mode access at stations is from 2013-14, bus stop data like this is the next best thing that we have.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the stops in the top 95 serve destinations that do not have heavy rail. Daniel Bowen has <a href=\"https://www.danielbowen.com/2020/07/03/sydney-vs-melb-rail-patronage/\" title=\"https://www.danielbowen.com/2020/07/03/sydney-vs-melb-rail-patronage/\">noted this before</a> as one of the key differences between Melbourne and Sydney and helps explain why the latter has train patronage around 50% higher than the former. Chadstone, Northland and Doncaster Shopping Centres are a few examples here.</p>\n\n<p>A final note to make is that the numbers at these stops are definitely higher than recorded in this data. As mentioned previously, I have excluded numbers from default ‘headless mode’ stops. In this data, these numbers comprised 6.5% of the total patronage figure. It’s rather strange because in the notes from DoT, they said that headless mode data is excluded and estimate it at around 10%, and yet it does seem to be in the spreadsheet that they sent.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, these numbers are not just raw myki touch ons and offs. They’re part of a changing formula used by DoT to estimate patronage (detailed notes included in the data on <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/philipmallis#!/vizhome/2018-19BusStopPatronageMelbourne/Map\">this page</a>).</p>\n\n<p>As always, if you have any thoughts or questions, please feel free to comment below.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2020/07/23/where-are-the-busiest-bus-stops-in-melbourne","relative_path":"_posts/2020-07-24-where-are-the-busiest-bus-stops-in-melbourne.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["History"],"layout":"post","id":2794,"title":"The tank that Australia built","date":"2020-08-05 16:00:00 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2794","header_position":["inherit"],"header_fullwidth":["inherit"],"page_header_styling":["inherit"],"heading_title":["0"],"custom_logo":[""],"custom_logo_width":[""],"custom_menu_skin":["default"],"sticky_menu_on_page":["default"],"custom_sticky_logo":[""],"sticky_menu_skin":["default"],"section_logo_switch":["0"],"footer_visibility":["inherit"],"fixed_footer":["inherit"],"footer_fullwidth":["inherit"],"featured_image_placing":["default"],"post_image_size":["inherit"],"page_custom_css":[""],"slide_template":["default"],"rs_page_bg_color":["#ffffff"],"auto_update_uri":["1"],"tags":["Military","Second World War"],"slug":"the-tank-that-australia-built","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>The story of Australia’s first locally-designed and manufactured tank is a fascinating one.

Mechanised warfare played out on a much larger scale than any other conflict in history. Although the idea that the Second World War was fought predominantly with mechanised weaponry is a bit of a myth, tanks were produced and used in greater numbers than in any conflict hence or since.</p>\n\n<p>Australia’s decision to build its own tank was very much a product of the time at which it was conceived. By mid-1940, the situation for the Allies was not looking too good. France and the Low Countries had fallen in an incredibly short period of time, Italy was preparing to mount an invasion of Egypt, and Germany seemed poised to launch a naval invasion of the British Isles.</p>\n\n<p>Australia at this time was worried about the prospects of the European Theatre. But importantly, we were also keeping a close eye on developments in the Pacific. While not having yet declared war on the Allies, Japan was becoming increasingly aggressive in the region. This obviously worried Australia as we would be right in their crosshairs should a conflict eventuate.</p>\n\n<p>These developments in Europe and the elimination of most of Britain’s allies meant that very little equipment could be spared for the defence of Australia. Winston Churchill and his government had made this quite clear on several occasions to Prime Minister Robert Menzies and subsequently John Curtin. Defending the Home Isles and the war in Europe were the top priorities.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>It was this atmosphere of fear and the lack of available vehicles or equipment that gave rise to the unusual and, I think, misguided decision to design and build our own tank.</p>\n\n<p>This was quite a big leap for a country of only seven million people, limited manufacturing capacity and no experience at all in tank design or fabrication. Design commenced in November 1940. But with little expertise domestically, Australia took inspiration from several existing tanks.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of a ‘Cruiser’ tank, which was the basis for this Australian tank, came from Britain when it was one of the leading countries in tank theory, research and development in the 1920s and 1930s. Basically it moved on from the First World War concept of an ‘infantry tank’ – that is a tank whose primary role was to support slow-moving foot soldiers. Relying on this supporting role for design typically resulted in tanks with thick armour but low speeds.</p>\n\n<p>Cruiser tanks reversed this concept. Much like the transition from battleships to battlecruisers, the new designs sacrificed armour for increased speed, manoeuvrability and agility. This reflected the forefront of armoured theory at the time from such people as B. H . Lidell Hart, John F. C. Fuller and Heinz Guderian. Their overall thesis was that tanks should not be constrained by the speed of infantry, but rather that they should be treated as a fast-paced and potent weapon in their own right. Taking advantage of the attributes of tanks could allow them to completely outflank and outmanoeuvre enemy forces to play havoc with their rear, including lightly-defended but vital supply lines, communications and transport.</p>\n\n<p>The tanks designed from the First World War were totally unfit for these purposes, which is why the Cruiser tank concept came into being.</p>\n\n<p>It was at this group of tanks that the Australian design team began looking. This was probably helped by the fact that Britain sent one of their own experienced tank designers, Colonel Watson, to assist. A French tank expert, Robert Perrier, was also involved in the process for several years. He was later to have quite a significant impact on the choice of engine and suspension, amongst other things that made the Sentinel quite a unique vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>The initial design was modelled against the British Crusader tank (not one of my favourites…) and also included some elements of the new M3 Grant tank from the United States. But although we did take some inspiration from existing tanks, the supply and manufacturing limitiations present in Australia at the time meant that most of the tank was in fact built and designed from scratch by Australians.</p>\n\n<p>By the time the Mark I design was completed in February 1942, in the same month as the most famous and damaging bombing of Darwin, it had changed to include more elements from the US design – probably a good metaphor for a similar <a href=\"http://john.curtin.edu.au/pmportal/text/00468.html\">change in our foreign policy</a> at the time. This made it less a strictly Cruiser tank, but was still mobile enough to meet the main needs of a modern, independent tank with a top speed of 48 kilometres per hour.</p>\n\n<p>The Sentinel was manufactured in Sydney by the New South Wales Railway Company. It was common during the Second World War for railway factories and infrastructure to be used for military purposes. Industrial capacity that is primarily designed to build locomotives can quite easily be converted into building military vehicles, especially for a country like Australia with limited heavy industry or manufacturing.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nla.obj-162650266-1.jpg)<figcaption>(Source: &lt;https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-162650266/view&gt;)</figcaption></figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7624560.jpg)<figcaption>(Source: &lt;https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C1217914&gt;)</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>I won’t go into many details about its armament, but like most Cruiser tanks it did not pack a sufficient punch. Its 2 pounder gun was quite out of date for a new design by the time production started in 1942. There were some good design elements, such as having a commander separate from other duties (something that several other tank designs lacked for some mystifying reason), reasonably adequate armour and a decent speed.</p>\n\n<p>This tank was also the first in the world to have a completely cast iron hull. The reason for doing this was not for accolades but purely practical. Australia didn’t possess the necessary welded plates that were used on tank models at the time, so this was put forward as a viable alternative.</p>\n\n<p>Overall it could hardly be called into the hall of fame of the greatest tanks of the War. But it wasn’t awful either. Many other countries with vastly more experience and expertise designed and built <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-35\">far</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenanter_tank\">worse</a> tanks than the Sentinel. I think we did pretty well, particularly considering the contraints that Australia had to work with at the time.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, no Sentinel tanks were ever used in combat. In fact, their only recorded use outside training and testing was in the 1944 film <em>The Rats of Tobruk</em>. As an aside, it’s quite a good movie and I’d recommend having a look.</p>\n\n<p>There are only a few surviving tanks today out of the 65 that were made. Different sources disagree on the exact number, but it’s somewhere between four and seven. I’m fortunate to have seen two out of the four still publicly accessible – one at the Royal Australian Armoured Corps (RAAC) museum <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2019/03/14/army-tank-museum-puckapunyal/\" title=\"Visit to the Army Tank Museum, Puckapunyal\">at Puckapunyal</a> and the other at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. The other survivors appear to be at the Australian Armour and Artillery Museum <a href=\"http://www.ausarmour.com/exhibits/\">in Brisbane</a> and the other at the Bovington Tank Museum in the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>Several other marks of the Sentinel tank were designed and some subsequent attempts at building and designing Australian tanks were made, but none were ever built to the same number as the Sentinel. It seems we learned a lot from this first round of tank design and subsequent tanks were significant improvements. We also began programs of modifying British and US tanks that were used by the Australian Army which resulted in some rather interesting and useful variants – such as the <a href=\"https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/australia/matilda-frog-and-murray-ft-flame-tank/\">Matilda Frog</a>, which was a Matilda tank with a flamethrower replacing the main gun. But after the experiments of designing our own tanks from scratch during the Second World War, Australia never attempted such a feat again.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Some argue that this whole project was a waste of valuable resources, labour and industrial capacity at the time. I agree that in hindsight, this was a poor decision. Even if the Japanese had invaded, a couple of cruiser tanks would not have been much help. It took until June 1943 to make just 65 vehicles – by which time any realistic threat of invasion had disappeared.</p>\n\n<p>The advantages that Australia possessed in resisting a Japanese invasion did not rest on the strength of its armoured corps. The military’s strategy at the time more sensibly relied on our geographical advantages; namely the vast expanse of inhospitable terrain that an invading army would have to cross, the remoteness of population centres from Japanese supply lines and the fact that any invading force would have to travel long distances in vulnerable conditions (i.e. by air or sea, neither of which are easy to pull off even under good circumstances).</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, even if these conditions were somehow overcome, Australian plans to resist called for guerilla warfare in the country, towns and cities. Regular military personnel would quickly train groups of civilians – such as preparing booby traps, laying mines and bushcraft – while the rest of the armed forces would fight delaying tactics (e.g. ambushes) to bog down the Japanese and let nature, disease and starvation take care of the rest.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, without going into too much more detail on this topic (which I might save for another post), my point is that the sorts of tactics that would have been the most effective against an invading force do not require tanks. In fact, for the sort of fighting that was expected or already expected, medium tanks are a hindrance. A large, heavy and conspicuous vehicle is not generally the sort of thing that you want to take into the jungle with you. Light tanks can have their uses, as the Americans and Japanese found in their island campaigns, but they are not generally necessary to fight effectively in these conditions.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, as I’ve said several times, Australia did not have large industrial capacity. We were suffering from equipment shortages throughout 1941 – 1943 for things as basic as rifles and uniforms. Allocating large factories to building several dozen tanks that would also need further industrial capacity for maintenance and repair seems to be a strange decision to make in light of this.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I am aware of the benefits of hindsight and I would not attribute too much blame to those who decided to go ahead with this project. It’s hard to imagine today how isolated Australia felt at the time and how desperate the situation seemed in the dark days of 1941-42. People really felt that Australia was on the edge of a precipice leading to invasion, occupation and subjugation. It’s easy to look back now, over 75 years later, and pass judgement. They should not be pilloried for this decision but I do think that they should have been able to at least understand the strain that building tanks would place on a fledgling manufacturing sector during a time of rationing and shortages.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The Sentinel was a significant feat for Australia, even with all its drawbacks and dubious necessity. For a country with a small population and without any experience in building a tank (and not even that much in operating them), building 65 armoured vehicles of reasonable quality is quite an amazing achievement that is worth remembering and celebrating.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"further-reading\">Further reading</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBte1uA-qOs\">Tank Chats</a>‘ video summary from the Bovington Tank Museum</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/Australia/AC1_Sentinel.php\">Tanks Encyclopedia</a> article</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.awm.gov.au/advanced-search?query=sentinel%20tank&amp;collection=true&amp;facet_type=Film\">Wartime films</a> featuring the Sentinel tank from the Australian War Memorial</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.awm.gov.au/advanced-search?query=sentinel%20tank&amp;collection=true&amp;facet_type=Photograph\">Photos</a> featuring the Sentinel tank from the Australian War Memorial</li>\n</ul>\n","url":"/blog/2020/08/05/the-tank-that-australia-built","relative_path":"_posts/2020-08-06-the-tank-that-australia-built.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["History"],"layout":"post","id":2875,"title":"75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War","date":"2020-08-14 16:00:00 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2875","header_position":["inherit"],"header_fullwidth":["inherit"],"page_header_styling":["inherit"],"heading_title":["0"],"custom_logo":[""],"custom_logo_width":[""],"custom_menu_skin":["default"],"sticky_menu_on_page":["default"],"custom_sticky_logo":[""],"sticky_menu_skin":["default"],"section_logo_switch":["0"],"footer_visibility":["inherit"],"fixed_footer":["inherit"],"footer_fullwidth":["inherit"],"featured_image_placing":["default"],"post_image_size":["inherit"],"page_custom_css":[""],"slide_template":["default"],"rs_page_bg_color":["#ffffff"],"tags":["Military","Second World War"],"slug":"75th-anniversary-of-the-end-of-the-second-world-war","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>15 August 2020 marks the 75th anniversary of the surrender of Japan in Australia.

We may never know the exact number of people killed or injured – it seems that every time we recount it keeps rising – but the present-day estimates now range between 70 and 80 million people.</p>\n\n<p>So what does this date signify and why should we care today?</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6164923.jpg)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>To start, let’s look at why V-P Day is commemorated on this particular day.</p>\n\n<p>Japan entered the war against the Allies on 7 December 1941 by launching surprise attacks against Hawaii, Malaya and other locations throughout Southeast Asia. They invaded and occupied thousands of kilometres of territory throughout the Pacific and South Asia while also continuing the brutal war in China. Eventually the combined Allied forces drove Japan out of most of these areas.</p>\n\n<p>By 1945, a sufficient number of airfields had been built or captured to allow the projection of huge amounts of air power over the Home Islands by the Allies. In an effort to avoid what would have been a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall\">protracted and unthinkably bloody invasion</a>, the United States used this air power to instead drop two atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the 6 and 9 August respectively. The very next day, 10 August, the Japanese Government informed the Allies of its intention to surrender, provided that the position of the Emperor was maintained.</p>\n\n<p>One other significant but lesser known event also played a large role in Japan’s decision to surrender. The same day that the second atomic bomb was dropped, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and commenced its invasion of Manchuria – something that Japan had feared for many decades.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why 15 August is V-P Day and not 10 August is because Japan’s surrender was not officially or publicly accepted by Emperor Hirohito in his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewel_Voice_Broadcast\">radio broadcast</a> until 15 August. Technically it was announced on 14 August in Japan, but due to the timezone difference, this news was not received in the United States and Europe until the 15th.</p>\n\n<p>As you can imagine, the news was greeted warmly all around the world. When the announcement by British Prime Minister Clement Atlee reached Australia over the wireless at 9am, people were understandably overjoyed.</p>\n\n<p>Atlee concluded his broadcast with: “Peace has once again come to the world. Let us thank God for His mercy.”</p>\n\n<p>Now let’s have a quick look at what it was like in Melbourne.</p>\n\n<p>People had a few days to prepare. The Commonwealth Government declared the 15 August as ‘Victory Day’. It also made it a public holiday and <a href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/204017999\">encouraged people</a> to “fly flags and decorate buildings with bunting”.</p>\n\n<p>Public transport in Melbourne continued to operate to cater for the huge crowds expected. Passenger trains ran as usual, while trams and buses ran to normal timetables but were stopped at the edges of the CBD to avoid conflicts with people on the streets. They also had to contend with a shortage of drivers who had either joined up with the armed forces over the duration of the war or were liable to join in the public celebrations. Night trams (yes they had those back then) would not operate into the CBD until 1am. If you’re interested in all the gunzelly details of transport for the day, see <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article204020566\">this link</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Hundreds of thousands of people flocked onto the city’s streets as the news was announced. Returned servicemen, police and civilians all joined in the celebrations.</p>\n\n<p>Crowds were everywhere, from St Paul’s Cathedral…</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4092060.jpg)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>…to the General Post Office on the corner of Bourke Street and Elizabeth Street…</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3967672.jpg)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>…and all the way up and down Collins Street.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4102046.jpg)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>People were, quite literally, singing and dancing in the streets.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7143532.jpg)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>In all the excitement, some apparently got a little too carried away. In an editorial on page 2 of <em>The Age</em> on 15 August, the newspaper <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article204020981\">condemned</a> the “irresponsible revellers” who caused havoc across parts of the city. This included breaking windows, setting off fire alarms and even “…interference with trolley poles [for trams] on gradients”.</p>\n\n<p>Celebrations weren’t confined to Melbourne of course, with celebrations across the world and the country. Victorian country towns, many of whom had lost quite a high proportion of their populations to two world wars in the space of a few decades, joined in welcoming the peace. Reports came in from right across the state, including <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page7188530\">Horsham</a>, <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page6105614\">Sale</a> and <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article69590631\">Wodonga</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the good burghers of Bacchus Marsh and Melton appear to have been somewhat more restrained. The <em>Express</em>, a local newspaper, <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page28271876\">reported</a> that: “There was no wild rejoicing, but instead a sober attitude and a general desire to find a quiet corner to ponder on the wondrous fact that Australia had emerged from six years of war”. The only commotion to occur was “a midnight clatter of tin cans, motor horns and the ringing of the bell at State School No. 28 [which] disturbed slumber to a certain degree”.</p>\n\n<p>But the 15 August wasn’t the end. Events and parties continued into the following weeks in Melbourne, including a <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page26702208\">Victory Day</a> parade down Swanston Street on 24 August with over 22,000 military personnel participating.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of trams, I couldn’t finish this post without including this photo of crowds outside Flinders Street Station, which includes a view of a tram and Princes Bridge Station in the background.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4105874.jpg)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>The Second World War had an indescribably large impact on pretty much everything that we have today.

This has generated a whole lot of ‘advice’ resources for people.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, despite good intentions, many of these are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/26/welcome-to-our-roads-new-cyclists-please-follow-these-rules-to-keep-everyone-happy\">misleading or plain wrong</a>. In some cases, they are downright dangerous by giving advice that could lead to unsafe situations.</p>\n\n<p>As a transport planner who also happens to ride a bike, I feel that now it’s now my turn.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/41726752502_bb3303cebb_c.jpg)</figure>\n<p>Please note that this advice applies <strong>only to Victoria</strong> as road rules and regulations are different in each state/territory. It is also not legal advice. For specific information and to clarify anything, check this <a href=\"https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/safety-and-road-rules/road-rules/a-to-z-of-road-rules/bicycles\">VicRoads webpage</a>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"you-do-not-have-to-ride-in-the-bike-lane-or-path\">You do not have to ride in the bike lane or path</h4>\n\n<p>The Victorian Road Rules state that people riding must use a bicycle lane if provided <strong>unless it is impractical to do so</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This is a very important point to make that several ‘advice’ articles have missed. There are many instances where you will have to ride outside of a designated bicycle lane or path for your safety and for the safety of others. I can’t possibly list them all, but things like potholes, glass or cars blocking the way are all perfectly legitimate reasons.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/48651723141/\" title=\"Taxi blocking bike lane with cyclist, Ringwood\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48651723141_efb4dd06a5_z.jpg\" alt=\"Taxi blocking bike lane with cyclist, Ringwood\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>For bicycle paths, VicRoads specifically states that <strong>you do not have to use an off-road bicycle or shared path</strong>. It is perfectly legal and legitimate to choose to ride on the road in these cases for any reason (unless otherwise signed).</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"you-can-ride-side-by-side-with-another-person\">You can ride side-by-side with another person</h4>\n\n<p>There are some important caveats to this rule, which you can check <a href=\"https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/safety-and-road-rules/road-rules/a-to-z-of-road-rules/bicycles\">here</a>, but by and large <strong>it is not illegal to ride ‘two abreast’ on-road</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This is a pretty simple, yet misunderstood, road rule.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"you-can-do-a-hook-turn-at-almost-any-intersection-you-want\">You can do a hook turn at almost any intersection you want</h4>\n\n<p>Recent changes to the Victorian Road Rules mean that unless there is a sign explicitly prohibiting them, people riding can make a hook turn at any intersection.</p>\n\n<p>This is a great little thing to know about because it can make right turns at major intersections a lot safer and less stressful.</p>\n\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s7GiUg1kczE\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"do-not-ride-in-the-dooring-zone\">Do not ride in the ‘dooring zone’</h4>\n\n<p>This is mainly for people new to riding who may not be as familiar as regular riders.</p>\n\n<p>Car ‘dooring’ is when a person opens their car door in the path of another person riding a bike. It is an offence under the Victorian Road Rules but is unfortunately far too common. The <a href=\"https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/safety-and-road-rules/cyclist-safety/car-doors-and-bike-riders\" title=\"https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/safety-and-road-rules/cyclist-safety/car-doors-and-bike-riders\">VicRoads website</a> states that over 770 instances of car dooring were recorded between 2011 and 2016. However, this is a huge underestimate as the vast majority of incidents go unreported.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/34503803863/\" title=\"Car door opening on Burke Road, Camberwell\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/4239/34503803863_54a7dbe8b2_z.jpg\" alt=\"Car door opening on Burke Road, Camberwell\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>My advice to new riders is to <strong>avoid the risk by riding outside the space where a car door could strike you</strong>. It can take some getting used to as you may have feel pressure from people driving behind you when you ride out into a traffic lane, but this is often the safest thing to do.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases there may not be enough room for you to safely do this. My advice in this instance would be to slow down to a speed where you can safely come to a stop in a short distance. It’s also good to look for telltale signs that a door may be about to open, like a face in a rearview mirror or brake lights.</p>\n\n<p>If you can and it’s not too impractical, I would recommend finding an alternative route to avoid high-risk areas. The ones that are notorious among regular riders (many of whom will avoid them) are generally the shopping strips of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Chapel Street</li>\n  <li>Sydney Road</li>\n  <li>Brunswick Street</li>\n  <li>Smith Street</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Streets in and near the CBD like St Kilda Road, Collins Street and Elizabeth Street are also hotspots.</p>\n\n<p>If you are doored, Maurice Blackburn have a good page <a href=\"https://www.mauriceblackburn.com.au/blog/2017/october/16/dooring-accidents-your-rights-as-a-cyclist/\">here</a> on what to do and your rights.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"you-do-not-need-any-special-equipment-or-clothing\">You do not need any special equipment or clothing</h4>\n\n<p>One of the brilliant things about riding is that it’s so simple and easy to get started.</p>\n\n<p>You don’t need any special clothes. You don’t need to be resplendent in lycra or high-viz fluro. You don’t need any attachments, GPS trackers or racing glasses.</p>\n\n<p>All you need is a helmet, a front and rear light, and a bike with a bell. That’s it.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/At-Middle-Park-Beach-9-July-2020-2-768x1024.jpg)</figure>\n<p>Unless you are planning on using a bike for racing or long recreational rides, there’s really nothing else you need.</p>\n\n<p>Of course there are plenty of things that you <em>could</em> have and possibly even <em>should</em> have (e.g. an Allen key, gloves) but all that can come later if you need it. Once you start riding, you will get a much better idea of what you might want for the types of trips that you are making and your particular style of riding. This is preferable than trying to guess when you’re just getting started.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I choose ride with a hi-viz vest and gloves because that is my preference, but I would never presume to force someone else to do so. They are what I prefer when riding and every rider has their own way of doing things. Which brings us to the next tip…</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"ride-to-your-ability-and-comfort-level\">Ride to your ability and comfort level</h4>\n\n<p>This one is really important. Basically, do not feel like you have to ever conform to any kind of stereotype or ‘norm’ around bike riding. Do not ride on busy roads if you don’t feel safe. Do not feel pressured to ride more quickly by someone else coming up behind you. Do not ride in a unsafe position on the road just because someone in a car is intimidating you.</p>\n\n<p>There is absolutely no shame in riding more slowly than others, taking a quiet back street or walking your bike up a steep hill. Riding a bike should be an enjoyable experience that anyone can do at their own pace and in their own way.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"plan-your-ride-if-you-want-to\">Plan your ride (if you want to)</h4>\n\n<p>This tip is here mainly for new riders who may not be familiar with local bike routes.</p>\n\n<p>Planning your trip on a bike is very different to planning one for if you are driving a car. You have to consider new things like the safety of a road, crossing points and the presence of tram tracks.</p>\n\n<p>Of course there is always the joy of just ‘going for a ride’ and meandering around without any sort of fixed route or destination, so not everything has to be organised in advance.</p>\n\n<p>But if you are new and would like some tips on where to ride, I am still offering free bicycle route planning (you can find details <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2020/03/23/offer-of-help-journey-planning-for-your-bicycle-route/\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"this-is-not-just-about-people-riding-bikes\">This is not just about people riding bikes</h4>\n\n<p>This final tip is that being safe on our streets is not just about cyclist behaviour or rules.</p>\n\n<p>I can’t emphasise this point enough.</p>\n\n<p>People driving must also take a lot of responsibility for making our streets safe. As many people who ride also drive cars, there are many things that you can do when driving to make things just that little bit safer:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Always look <strong>before</strong> opening your car door. Make sure that this involves you physically turning around and not just your rear view mirrors – they have blind spots!</li>\n  <li>Leave a safe distance between your vehicle and the person riding a bike when overtaking. Generally this is no less than a metre, which is what <a href=\"https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/other/cyclists\">other jurisdictions</a> have adopted as law.</li>\n  <li>Do not stop in bicycle ‘head start’ boxes at intersections. This is illegal and can put riders at risk by not allowing them space to get in front of cars waiting at intersections to avoid being ‘squeezed’ by moving traffic.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/28450223895/\" title=\"Bike box on Ward Street, North Adelaide\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/8882/28450223895_a3cff6ac43_z.jpg\" alt=\"Bike box on Ward Street, North Adelaide\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"get-out-there-and-ride\">Get out there and ride!</h4>\n\n<p>The liberating feeling of riding a bicycle is incomparable. You can go wherever you want at your own pace and under your own power. You don’t have to fill up with petrol, you save money and you have a lot more route options than if you were driving a car.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience you will also develop your abilities to be calm and let things go. In almost all near-misses or incidents that I have experienced while riding, they were the result of carelessness or ignorance from the person driving rather than any deliberate aggression or violence. Once you realise that all of these hazards that people cause are nothing about someone hating you specifically as a person, it makes dealing with them a lot easier. This is something that will only come with time, experience and a lot of patience.</p>\n\n<p>Despite everything that I’ve said, I really hope that this hasn’t scared anyone off riding. I ride thousands of kilometres every year in every setting from beautiful <a href=\"https://www.railtrails.org.au/\">rail trails</a> in the countryside to high-volume urban roads (when I absolutely have to) and the vast majority of my trips are incident-free. It is, in my opinion, an amazing way to get around and has undoubtedly changed my life.</p>\n\n<p>If you haven’t experienced the freedom of riding before, now is the time to try.</p>\n\n<p>Let me know below if you have any questions and I’ll do my best to help you out.

These range from curious bystanders asking a question to overzealous security guards attempting to intimidate you and force you to leave.</p>\n\n<p>My main run ins have been on transport infrastructure. On one <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philipmallis/status/1027154728487010304\">particularly memorable occasion</a>, the Clifton Hill duty controller made an announcement across the entire Hurstbridge Line to specifically tell me to leave Fairfield Station as “photography is not permitted” (which is wrong).

Unfortunately it has been recently updated and is now utterly confusing, but still seems to say the same thing (just with ten times the number of words).</p>\n\n<p>Any photography on the network is subject to several conditions which also listed on their website – e.g. Southern Cross Station requires a special permit.</p>\n\n<p>But some of these are quite silly when looked at in any contemporary context. For example, one of the directions is: “Any filming or photography on trains cannot be conducted during peak travel periods”, with a corresponding one stating that: “You cannot capture images on board a train without a Metro permit”. Taken at face value, this would mean that the thousands of people who take photos on their mobile phones to complain about late or congested trains on Twitter (including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrew_lund/status/469244190421831680\">journalists</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidDavisMLC/status/1062771739539603456\">MPs</a>) are subject to enforcement action.</p>\n\n<p>That’s not to say that there shouldn’t be any standards at all – clearly a line has to be drawn somewhere for the safety and amenity of passengers and staff. But what seems to have happened is that random bits and pieces have been added and changed without much thought for the wider picture.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/49642878947/\" title=\"Photography prohibition signs on front of Melbourne Metro Tunnel construction site at Arden Station, North Melbourne\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49642878947_d33f2b96b2_z.jpg\" alt=\"Photography prohibition signs on front of Melbourne Metro Tunnel construction site at Arden Station, North Melbourne\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>What should happen is a proper review of these guidelines across all transport infrastructure (<a href=\"https://yarratrams.com.au/advertising-and-film-information\">Yarra Tram’s guidelines</a> are simpler but include the same impractical clauses) in consultation with groups like the PTUA and hobby photographers to come up with a workable and reasonable solution.</p>\n\n<p>Once this is done, proper training of staff should also take place. Most of the incidents in which I have been involved have been the result of staff misunderstanding or not knowing about the actual rights and obligations of non-commercial photographers.</p>\n\n<p>Most recently I was taking photos of a plaque at Glenferrie Station with my phone. The Metro Trains employee at the the myki gates then approached me and said “you need a permit to take photos”.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to explain to him that I did not need a permit as it was not commercial photography, but he wouldn’t have a bar of it. I ended up just going up to the platforms to catch my train as I didn’t want to have a confrontation.</p>\n\n<p>I made a formal complaint to Metro Trains afterwards who replied:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You have advised that you were told by our staff member at Glenferrie station on that evening that you required to have a permit to take non–commercial photos at the station.</p>\n\n  <p>I’m sorry for your experience.</p>\n\n  <p>Whilst a permit is required to be obtained by professionals or students, a permit is no longer required for personal filming and photography. I have forwarded a copy of your feedback to our Passenger Service Manager for Glenferrie station to ensure our staff are aware of the current Filming and Photography requirements</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The main point of all this is to outline some of the the ongoing problems caused to hobby photographers like myself who find themselves in unnecessarily confrontational situations. As I said, some people are reasonable and will leave you alone or even help you out. But those station staff, security guards, etc. who go in all guns blazing when they have no legal right to do so aren’t doing anyone any favours. There needs to be clarity and common sense when it comes to these issues.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in more information there is <a href=\"https://www.artslaw.com.au/information-sheet/street-photographers-rights/#_ftn1\">this excellent information page</a> from the Arts Law Centre of Australia.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2020/10/07/the-right-to-photograph-trains","relative_path":"_posts/2020-10-08-the-right-to-photograph-trains.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport"],"layout":"post","id":3044,"title":"How to improve PTV disruption information","date":"2020-10-16 18:01:30 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=3044","slide_template":["default"],"rs_page_bg_color":["#ffffff"],"auto_update_uri":["1"],"tags":["PTV"],"slug":"how-to-improve-ptv-disruption-information","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>Despite some recent changes, I think there is still a lot of work to be done to improve the quality and accessibility of rail disruption information in Melbourne.</p>\n","content":"<p>Despite some recent changes, I think there is still a lot of work to be done to improve the quality and accessibility of rail disruption information in Melbourne.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the main ‘Disruptions’ page on the PTV website, accessible here: <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/disruptions/disruptions-information/\">https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/disruptions/disruptions-information/</a></p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disruptions1-1024x636.png)</figure>\n<p>If you are a passenger looking at this screen, you might thing that all is going pretty well. There is a mix of green and yellow dots but nothing that looks too serious.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not until you click on an individual line that a little popup box tells you ‘Buses replace trains in October 2020’.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disruptions2.png)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>As you can see, the shutdown of an entire railway line for several days apparently falls under the same category of importance as a couple of carparking spaces closed at South Kensington. This seems odd when you compare the level and scale of each disruption. One impacts, at worst, a few dozen people, while the other is a series of days where an entire railway line with tens of thousands of passengers is shut down completely.</p>\n\n<p>Once you click on ‘read more’, the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201010105157/https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/disruptions/disruptions-information/article/werribee-line-buses-replace-trains-in-october-2020\">disruptions page</a> is long, confusing and doesn’t communicate key information well.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disruptions5-1024x680.png)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>Almost all the information in displayed as a huge wall of text without any navigation assistance beyond simple bold text as headings (which aren’t even built as <a href=\"https://way2tutorial.com/html/html_internal_links.php\">internal page links)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The first sentence on the page offers little information on what “project and maintenance works” are. Many other transport networks provide more detail on what is happening which helps to reduce confusion and improve understanding amongst the travelling public. Fewer irate passengers is a good thing for everyone and more (well-presented) information tends to help.</p>\n\n<p>But this is a minor sidenote compared to the issues on the rest of this page.</p>\n\n<p>The links to the replacement bus frequency in the table send passengers to a <a href=\"https://www.metrotrains.com.au/planned-works/?pwId=376989\">separate webpage</a> on the Metro Trains website. This is a small improvement on the old multi-page PDFs but it is not an easy page to understand.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disruptions6.png)</figure>\n<p>The most important thing to note here is that this page does not explicitly state anywhere that buses are replacing trains. It may seem obvious after reading the previous few paragraphs, but having ‘Planned works details’ as the largest text on the page is not the clearest way to convey what is arguably the main thing that people need to know.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, just having a vague ‘bus frequency’ as the alternative transport information is not very useful – especially for such large gaps between services. What passengers need to know in relation to the service is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>When do I need to be at the station to catch the bus? Will it be the same time as my regular train?</li>\n  <li>Will a bus wait for a train at Newport or will it depart at a specific time?</li>\n  <li>Will trains continue from Newport to Flinders Street?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>None of these questions are answered clearly (or at all) on this page.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you hover over the station names on this page you can see where the bus stops are located. This is definitely an improvement on the lengthy attempts to describe their locations by PTV using text, but we’ll get to that later.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disruptions7.png)</figure>\n<p>My main issue here is that you don’t know that these maps exist unless you happen to move your cursor over the station names on the right. Otherwise you have to rely on the PTV disruptions page, which we will return to now.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disruptions9.png)</figure>\n<p>The last but longest section on the PTV page is a long table giving a detailed description of the locations of every bus replacement stop at each station. This can be handy if the maps aren’t working, for people using screenreaders or if the stops are hard to find. But it does take up an awful lot of space. More importantly, this is the information that is put in front of passengers first rather than any visual graphics which would explain this much more quickly and easily in a smaller format.</p>\n\n<p>None of this is helped by the poor formatting of the page, which relies on a single column of HTML content. There are many more efficient ways to organise information on webpages and we should be utilising these to arrange information in a clearer way.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, just to add to the confusion, there is one disruption in the list on this page which does not link to the Metro Trains website as we saw above with all the others (the one called ‘<a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/disruptions/disruptions-information/article/werribee-and-williamstown-lines-buses-replace-trains-from-7-25pm-to-last-train-each-night-from-monday-12-october-to-thursday-15-october-2020\">Newport and Werribee, 7.25pm to last train each night</a>‘). Instead, this one disruption has <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201010112132/https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/disruptions/disruptions-information/article/werribee-and-williamstown-lines-buses-replace-trains-from-7-25pm-to-last-train-each-night-from-monday-12-october-to-thursday-15-october-2020\">its own PTV page</a> which contains all the bus replacement information in a different format. This page is even more vague, explaining that the disruption is happening due to “works”.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disruptions8-1024x743.png)</figure>\n<p>It’s unclear to me why this particular disruption is treated differently to all the others in this list.</p>\n\n<p>So how can we make this better?</p>\n\n<p>Coming up with a decent system would be quite easy. Every public transport system has some sort of online presence and there are plenty of good examples to get ideas.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone from PTV is looking for some inspiration, London’s disruptions page below makes a lot more sense (accessible here: <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/tube-dlr-overground/status/\">https://tfl.gov.uk/tube-dlr-overground/status/</a>)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disruptions3-1024x766.png)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>The first thing to notice is the map on the right. Not only is it interactive, but it displays all the disruptions listed on the left visually – depending on the time and day selected. This makes it much easier for people to understand what’s happening – and, importantly, to work out alternative travel options.</p>\n\n<p>The second important thing here is the categories. ‘Planned closure’ is a separate category in itself, as is ‘part closure’. Disruptions like carpark closures, bins falling over or other lower-order issues are kept to each station rather than sending out constant alerts across the entire line at a level equal to bus replacements.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you click on a disruption, it gives you viable alternative transport options and a direct link to the journey planner if these don’t work. This only seems to happen haphazardly in Melbourne, and usually only on Twitter when there are major disruptions. This normally results in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bigbutchy21/status/1227713572551176192\">vague</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yarratrams/status/1101366702951096320\">impractical</a> advice being disseminated. Even for a rail line shutdown, there is <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201010105157/https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/disruptions/disruptions-information/article/werribee-line-buses-replace-trains-in-october-2020\">little information</a> for any alternative public transport other than bus replacements (even though other options exist and would likely get many people to where they need more quickly).</p>\n\n<p>What do we learn from all this?</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that during a disruption, passengers need to know four key pieces of information:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>What is happening (and why)?</li>\n  <li>How am I affected?</li>\n  <li>How can I get where I need in the quickest and easiest way possible?</li>\n  <li>Where can I find more information?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All of this needs to be communicated with the minimum amount of space and time. The best examples of this communication show that graphics trump walls of text (although you always need text as well to account for accessibility). Detail is important but should not be the first thing that you put in front of people. You need a quick summary from which you can glean the important information in under 15-20 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>As I’ve said above, the current situation is an improvement on at least the recent past. Social media, high market penetration of smartphones and the rapid advancement of mapping technology have all helped. Now we just have to figure out how to make the best use of these tools.</p>\n\n<p>Some further reading on this topic from Monash University: <a href=\"http://publictransportresearchgroup.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PRESENTATION-2016-ARA-Forum-Unplanned-Rail-Disruptions.pdf\">http://publictransportresearchgroup.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PRESENTATION-2016-ARA-Forum-Unplanned-Rail-Disruptions.pdf</a></p>\n","url":"/blog/2020/10/16/how-to-improve-ptv-disruption-information","relative_path":"_posts/2020-10-17-how-to-improve-ptv-disruption-information.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Cycling"],"layout":"post","id":2746,"title":"Why gunzels should want more rail trails","date":"2020-10-21 16:00:00 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=2746","header_position":["inherit"],"header_fullwidth":["inherit"],"page_header_styling":["inherit"],"heading_title":["0"],"custom_logo":[""],"custom_logo_width":[""],"custom_menu_skin":["default"],"sticky_menu_on_page":["default"],"custom_sticky_logo":[""],"sticky_menu_skin":["default"],"section_logo_switch":["0"],"footer_visibility":["inherit"],"fixed_footer":["inherit"],"footer_fullwidth":["inherit"],"featured_image_placing":["default"],"post_image_size":["inherit"],"page_custom_css":[""],"slide_template":[""],"rs_page_bg_color":[""],"slug":"why-gunzels-should-want-more-rail-trails","ext":".md","tags":[],"excerpt":"<p>I have been a member of a few rail enthusiast groups on Facebook for several years.</p>\n","content":"<p>I have been a member of a few rail enthusiast groups on Facebook for several years.</p>\n\n<p>Something that happens in these groups almost every fortnight is that someone will post about a dismantled railway somewhere. This will inevitably trigger a wave of comments from many of the resident foamers about:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>How awful it is that the railway is closed</li>\n  <li>What crying shame it is that rail trails are replacing a former railway with its remnant infrastructure</li>\n  <li>Jokes about how nobody uses the trails and that they are a waste of money</li>\n  <li>Something something BLOODY CYCLISTS something something</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some try to have a reasoned discussion, while others are pretty blatant about their underlying reasons, like Steve here:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steve.jpg)</figure>\n<p>And this, unfortunately, is what it boils down to in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/QueenslandRailwaysIllustrated/posts/306278220790805\">many of these threads</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So without going into excruciating detail on every possible argument about this important topic, what do we actually know about rail trails and their benefits or drawbacks? What hard data is available and what can we discern from those that already exist? And why should gunzels actually want to support rail trails?</p>\n\n<p>(Note: for the uninitiated, a ‘<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gunzel#:~:text=Noun,US\">gunzel</a>%20Alternative%20spelling%20of%20gunsel.)‘ is a Victorian word for a transport enthusiast – primarily rail).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"people-use-rail-trails-a-lot\">People use rail trails a lot</h3>\n\n<p>The first point to make is that rail trails are well used.</p>\n\n<p>There are several permanent bicycle counters on rail trails within metropolitan Melbourne, so let’s start by looking at those. Unfortunately, I can’t see any permanent bike counters on rail trails in regional Victoria so we’ll have to stick to Melbourne for the time being.</p>\n\n<p>The Outer Circle Trail (also called the Anniversary Trail) has multiple counters. This path follows most of the original route of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Circle_railway_line\">Outer Circle Line</a>, which once linked Fairfield to Oakleigh via the salubrious suburbs of Boroondara including East Kew, Canterbury and Ashburton. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamein_railway_line\">Alamein Line</a> remains the only operating segment of it today. The railway didn’t last long due to a lack of passenger or freight demand, with the last train running on track not part of the Alamein Line in 1943. The Outer Circle Trail was then built in stages from 1991.</p>\n\n<p>Ignoring 2020 numbers which are incomplete, let’s look at bicycle volumes for 2019. In total, there were over <a href=\"https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/traffic-and-road-use/road-network-and-performance/road-use-and-performance\">115,000 bicycles</a> recorded over the year. From <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x-wK-zGeGj2IVUnS7s0GV4quiFFT4bey/view?usp=sharing\">previous surveys</a>, we know that the number of people walking or wheeling is roughly the same as the number of people riding – so we can estimate the total yearly usage at roughly 230,000 people.</p>\n\n<p>But what about rail trails in regional areas? While we only have irregular surveys to go off, they do show good usage. The newest rail trail in Victoria, the Yarra Valley Trail (under construction), saw over <a href=\"https://www.rideyarraranges.com.au/yarra-valley-trail-stage-1-update/\">60,000 people</a> in its first seven months of operation despite COVID-19 travel restrictions. The High Country region of Victoria sees over <a href=\"https://www.rdv.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/1740124/Attachment-A-Cycle-Tourism-Investment-Opportunities-in-Victorias-High-Country-FINAL-19-Feb-19_web.pdf\">103,000 ‘cycle tourists’</a> each year.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/32547190264/\" title=\"Cyclists wait to cross Warburton Highway, Wandin\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/770/32547190264_5169e3efe0_z.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists wait to cross Warburton Highway, Wandin\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>This usage translates into significant economic benefits for the regions through which they run. Again, I won’t go into a lot of detail, but many previous academic <a href=\"http://www.yooyahcloud.com/CYCLETOURISMAUSTRALIA/yCwtDb/Beeton_MTM_Rail_Trail.pdf\">research papers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.yarraranges.vic.gov.au/files/assets/public/webdocuments/build-develop/projects-initiatives/yarra_valley_trail_-_economic_impact_assessment.pdf\">business cases</a> and <a href=\"http://www.northernriversrailtrail.org.au/rail-trails-work/economic-benefits/case-study-2-australian-rail-trails/\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.rdv.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/1740124/Attachment-A-Cycle-Tourism-Investment-Opportunities-in-Victorias-High-Country-FINAL-19-Feb-19_web.pdf\">studies</a> have found that rail trails bring large benefits for local and regional economies. They often have cost-benefit ratios that other infrastructure projects would kill for.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-trails-benefit-railways-too\">Rail trails benefit railways too</h3>\n\n<p>Many of the other arguments against rail trails assume that they cause harm to disused or abandoned railway infrastructure or somehow prevent them being reopened in the future. This is assertion is particularly common from gunzels for obvious reasons.</p>\n\n<p>However, in response I would make the point that rail trails help to preserve and celebrate railways.</p>\n\n<p>I will return to the Outer Circle Trail here as a great example of this. I’ll also look at a regional case afterwards to reinforce that I am not an inward-looking city-slicker… (plus most of the rail trails in Victoria are in regional areas).</p>\n\n<p>A large part of building the Outer Circle Trail in the first place was to create a series of historical markers and celebrate the extensive rail heritage on the way. Bridges were restored, interpretative artwork and infrastructre was built and information signage was located at points of interest. All of these still stand to this day and have helped to spread the word about this ‘<a href=\"http://outercircleline.com.au\">forgotten railway</a>‘.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/49531503763/\" title=\"Outer Circle Trail at Rubens Grove bridge, Deepdene\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49531503763_8a7ecf5121_z.jpg\" alt=\"Outer Circle Trail at Rubens Grove bridge, Deepdene\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/31414443706/\" title=\"Alamein Station historical sign\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/5815/31414443706_5f838dc3e5_z.jpg\" alt=\"Alamein Station historical sign\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>Without the rail trail, the former railway would like remain as vacant land or have been slowly subdivided and sold. This is what has happened to many other former rail reservations that didn’t have this treatment like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Koroit_railway_line\">Hamilton-Koroit Line</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosstown_Railway\">Rosstown Railway</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I think you would be hard pressed to find someone to argue that this would have been a preferable outcome for the former Outer Circle Line.</p>\n\n<p>There are many regional examples of rail trails being a boon to Australia’s rich railway history. I’ve written before about some of these, for example the <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2018/12/10/bicycle-trip-okeefe-rail-trail/\" title=\"Bicycle trip: O’Keefe Rail Trail\">O’Keefe Rail Trail</a> on the Bendigo – Heathcote Line and the <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2017/12/24/bicycle-trip-gippsland-plains-rail-trail/\" title=\"Bicycle trip: Gippsland Plains Rail Trail\">Gippsland Plains Rail Trail</a> from Stratford to Traralgon.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/46162323912\" title=\"Site of former Axedale Station with VR wagon\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/4898/46162323912_206f0f7865_z.jpg\" alt=\"Site of former Axedale Station with VR wagon\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>I won’t labour the point, but all the rail trails that I have ridden have had great examples of restored railway infrastructure, historical markers and other points of interest. As above with the preservation of land, without the rail trail it’s likely that these would have been removed, sold or left to rot.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"false-dichotomy\">False dichotomy</h3>\n\n<p>Even if none of the above was true, most of the arguments against rail trails rely on the incorrect premise that we can only have rail trails <strong>instead of</strong> railways.</p>\n\n<p>This is demonstrably and theoretically not the case.</p>\n\n<p>There are many examples where trails and railways happily run alongside each other – the Djerring Trail, Sunshine to Footscray Trail and Box Hill to Ringwood Trail are three examples off the top of my head. One recent example that shows this very well is the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/daylesfordrailway/photos/a.536322093104966/4394172627319874/\">extension</a> of the Daylesford Spa Country Rail which includes a new rail trail running alongside it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/31414456946/\" title=\"Ashburton Railway Station\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/5583/31414456946_d3436a020d_z.jpg\" alt=\"Ashburton Railway Station\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>Yes, there are some examples where closed rail infrastructure has been removed or modified for a rail trail. Probably the most recent and controversial example has been part of the South Gippsland Railway. Many people in the gunzel Facebook groups railed (ha) against the construction of this trail because sleepers and other materials were being removed.</p>\n\n<p>This argument ignores the fact that the infrastructure is often <a href=\"https://abandonedbutnotforgotten1.blogspot.com/2015/05/south-gippsland-railway-line-bridge-at_17.html\">old and totally unsuitable for use</a> on an operational railway. There has probably been no maintenance or upkeep for decades, which means that even if we had a rail service reinstated tomorrow it would require replacing this infrastructure anyway. Moreover, it is not the cost of installing sleepers and tracks that prevents these lines from reopening. Often it is other factors like land availability, bridge/tunnel construction or rolling stock.</p>\n\n<p>But the most likely reason is that many of these lines are simply not viable to run. As acknowledged by even most gunzels, plenty of lines built in the <a href=\"https://maps.philipmallis.com/1928-victorian-railways-historical-map/\">frenzy of construction</a> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were purely speculative. Even when they were in full operation many of them turned <a href=\"https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/papers/govpub/VPARL1945-47No24.pdf\">massive losses</a> for Victorian Railways.</p>\n\n<p>This is not to say that every closed railway was not, or would not, be a viable operation. There are quite a few abandoned or disused railways around that have good cases to make for their reopening. But this is not the majority.</p>\n\n<p>A rail trail does nothing to stop such a railway from reopening. Indeed, as I argued above, it would actually make it easier for something like this to happen. The infrastructure that is actually able to be reused if rail services were to resume is the very same that rail trails don’t remove – or, in many cases, actually use and upgrade (e.g. bridges and station buildings). Without the rail trail, these often quickly fall into neglect or are removed altogether. Rotting wooden sleepers and bits of rusted track aren’t much help in this eventuality.</p>\n\n<p>Returning to the South Gippsland Railway as the latest example, there are in fact some gunzels making <a href=\"https://www.railpage.com.au/news/s/stop-the-destruction-of-the-south-gippsland-railway-line-under-the-unelected-council\">this exact argument</a> that railways and rail trails can and should coexist. But occurrences like these do not show anything inherently bad about rail trails. The underlying issue seems to not be related to anything specific to trails themselves but rather that rail infrastructure is being removed or otherwise changed to be replaced by something else. Whether this is a bike or walking path should be immaterial to this argument. If this is the problem, then the solution isn’t to stop rail trails – it’s to argue in favour of retaining railways (if that’s considered the best result).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/45220175681/\" title=\"Koroit Station on Warrnambool to Port Fairy Rail Trail\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/1917/45220175681_0c720d6cca_z.jpg\" alt=\"Koroit Station on Warrnambool to Port Fairy Rail Trail\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/41134016252/in/album-72157676733966672/\" title=\"Old railway bridge at Warburton\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/881/41134016252_cfd9823dc5_z.jpg\" alt=\"Old railway bridge at Warburton\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>To reiterate, rail trails <strong>do not have to replace railways</strong>. They can happily co-exist and there are plenty of examples where this is the case for both operating and closed railways. In the event that potentially useful rail infrastructure is affected by trail construction, this is a design issue and not one that is inherent to rail trails. Using it as a blanket argument against them doesn’t make sense.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-does-this-all-mean\">What does this all mean?</h3>\n\n<p>To summarise, rail trails:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Are well-used and bring economic benefits to local communities</li>\n  <li>Can be a great opportunity to preserve and celebrate rail heritage</li>\n  <li>Reserve land for any future rail transport infrastructure</li>\n  <li>Assist the process of a railway being re-opened</li>\n  <li>Can easily co-exist with rail infrastructure</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-call-for-unity\">A call for unity</h3>\n\n<p>So what’s next?</p>\n\n<p>It is clear that there are differing views within the gunzel community about rail trails.</p>\n\n<p>That’s fine, but we should all recognise that they have played and continue to play a significant role in the preservation of our extensive transport heritage and future transport planning.</p>\n\n<p>They preserve vital parcels of property should a railway or other transport connection ever be required. This is largely because they keep this area in active use. If there is nothing there utilising this land, anyone wishing to argue to sell it suddenly has a much more compelling case. This detrimentally impacts on what many rail gunzels want to see – a resumption and/or expansion of the heavy rail network in Australia.</p>\n\n<p>Continuing to oppose rail trails using these arguments from fellow gunzels doesn’t make much sense to me. They help to maintain and showcase heritage by providing public access, economically support local communities who may have suffered after the withdrawal of rail services, and preserve land in active use for any possible reinstatement.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I think it is high time that gunzels, rail trail users and local communities join together in their efforts. These benefit everyone and we should all be pulling in the same direction rather than squabbling. If this happened, I’m sure that better results could be achieved.</p>\n\n<p>What can this look like in practice? Well imagine that some new hypothetical rail trail is proposed on a long-abandoned country line.</p>\n\n<p>Gunzels could help identify, document and preserve remnant infrastructure in its original place (e.g. stations, bridges, signals). Rail trail users could give feedback on the type and service quality of the rail trail (e.g. path surface, route, width). Finally, local communities and businesses could help care for and maintain the trail once it is built (e.g. <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/friendsbrt/\">friends groups</a>).</p>\n\n<p>With everyone talking to each other, better results can be achieved that don’t adversely affect each group’s interests. For example, if an important rail heritage site is identified that would be affected by construction, gunzels could work with rail trail users and local communities to come up with an alternative route that is still practical but doesn’t impact the preservation site. This is a much more constructive and successful tactic than just shouting “rail trails suck!” from the sidelines.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, as both a rail trail user and gunzel, it is in the best interests of everyone to support these important pieces of community infrastructure as they equally benefit both groups. It’s time to work together.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2020/10/21/why-gunzels-should-want-more-rail-trails","relative_path":"_posts/2020-10-22-why-gunzels-should-want-more-rail-trails.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Local history"],"layout":"post","id":3062,"title":"From white to grey &#8211; a little bit of North Balwyn history","date":"2020-11-04 15:00:00 -0600","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=3062","slide_template":["default"],"rs_page_bg_color":["#ffffff"],"auto_update_uri":["1"],"tags":["North Balwyn","Road names"],"slug":"from-white-to-grey-a-little-bit-of-north-balwyn-history","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>At only 1.6 kilometres, Greythorn Road is one of the shortest main roads in Boroondara.</p>\n","content":"<p>At only 1.6 kilometres, Greythorn Road is one of the shortest main roads in Boroondara.</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=145.08032083511355%2C-37.805206598036186%2C145.11615514755252%2C-37.79023497080685&amp;layer=mapnik\" style=\"border: 1px solid black\" width=\"425\"></iframe>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/-37.7977/145.0982\">View Larger Map</a></small>It shares its name with Greythorn, a locality within North Balwyn.

This in turn had been named for a white horse owned by Henry Elgar, an early surveyor of these districts who can be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgar%27s_Special_Survey\">directly blamed</a> for many of the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/FVRzytQ2Dsy4Fqf87\">road layout curiosities</a> in Boroondara and Whitehorse.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/46647303215/\" title=\"Whitehorse Road looking east, Balwyn\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/7870/46647303215_2ab8ac74ee_z.jpg\" alt=\"Whitehorse Road looking east, Balwyn\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>Such close proximity of Whitethorn Road and Whitehorse Road obviously caused a lot of confusion amongst non-locals and a source of constant annoyance for those who lived in the area.

John Brack lived here</h3>\n\n<p>Most famous for his painting <em><a href=\"https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/3161/\">Collins Street, 5p.m.</a></em>, the 20th-century artist, John Brack, <a href=\"https://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2018-06/Maud-Street-Precinct-Heritage-Citation-Revised-for-panel.pdf\">lived</a> at <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/GN24oRoq8iussV4C6\">33 Maud Street</a> from 1953 to 1962.</p>\n\n<p>This is reflected in some of his work during this period, such as <em><a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/john-brack/north-balwyn-tram-terminal-QtPIHeNCqfmG9xPEFnve8Q2\">North Balwyn tram terminal</a></em> which was painted on Tuxen Street looking towards the corner of Balwyn Road and Doncaster Road.

The first Coles supermarket was in North Balwyn</h3>\n\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coles_Group\">first Coles shop</a> was on Smith Street in Collingwood, the first ‘supermarket’ opened on the corner of Burke Road and Doncaster Road in North Balwyn.</p>\n\n<p>It was originally known as ‘Dickens’, named after <a href=\"https://australianfoodtimeline.com.au/1958-coles-dickins-groceries/\">the company</a> that Coles had acquired in 1958.</p>\n\n<p>The supermarket officially opened on 3 March 1960 with a lot of fanfare. The book <em>A Timeline of Australian Food: from mutton to MasterChef</em> (which I highly recommend – <a href=\"https://australianfoodtimeline.com.au/mutton-masterchef/\">see more information on how to purchase it here</a>) describes it thus:</p>\n\n<p>“<em>The North Balwyn store was the first of Coles’ true supermarkets in that it combined variety merchandise with food items – a revolutionary idea at the time. It was Edgar [Coles]’s plan that eventually Coles would run a chain of supermarkets that would allow a housewife to make one single shopping trip for most of her weekly needs, be they foodstuffs or variety goods. Needless to say, it was a very popular idea!</em>“</p>\n\n<p>The opening itself was a grand occasion. This new type of shop was a huge novelty at the time and thousands of people came to try out this new shopping experience.</p>\n\n<p>But why did this happen in North Balwyn? At the time, it was a newly-developed, post-war suburb. This meant that cars played a large and increasing role in its layout and transport patterns. The car, like the supermarket, was the latest and greatest thing during this period of great technological advancement (this was also the time when the Space Race was kicking off in a big way).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I can’t find any Creative Commons photos that I can use on this blog, so if you want to see some photos check out <a href=\"https://www.australianfoodtimeline.com.au/wp-content/uploads/1960/09/Chapter-5-2.pdf\">this book extract</a> from <em>A Timeline of Australian Food</em>.</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:40px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"4-there-were-once-two-high-schools\">4. There were once two high schools</h3>\n\n<p>Today Balwyn High School is the only public secondary educational institute in North Balwyn. However, until a few decades ago, there were two.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greythorn_High_School\">Greythorn High School</a> was located on the corner of Greythorn Road and Doncaster Road in the eastern part of the suburb. It opened in February 1958, only four years afer the opening of Balwyn High. This was an area of rapid growth after the Second World War and education authorities wanted to ensure adequate capacity for the number of students expected in the vicinity.</p>\n\n<p>In 1992, the school merged with Balwyn High. Its buildings operated as a second campus for Balwyn High. However, the buildings were closed just two years later. The land was subsequently sold for a residential development.</p>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" aria-hidden=\"false\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d1925.4073013461357!2d145.0978406162764!3d-37.792247965839636!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x0!2zMzfCsDQ3JzMxLjciUyAxNDXCsDA1JzUzLjIiRQ!5e1!3m2!1sen!2sau!4v1611713781933!5m2!1sen!2sau\" style=\"border:0;\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"600\"></iframe>\n<p>Many former students are still in touch, via networks like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/5976369745/\">this Facebook group</a>.</p>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:40px\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"5-until-the-1940s-it-was-mostly-farms\">5. Until the 1940s, it was mostly farms</h3>\n\n<p>North Balwyn was the last area of Boroondara to be fully developed. Before the post-WW2 housing boom, the area was mostly used for agriculture. There was a variety of farms during this time. Most of them grew citrus or were used for dairy cows.</p>\n\n<p>There were several large estates and families, many of whom had owned the same land for decades. This included the Buchanans after whom Buchanan Avenue is named.</p>\n\n<p>After the Second World War, the housing market exploded and suburban sprawl took hold in Melbourne. North Balwyn became the new frontier of progress and development and grew at a very rapid pace. By 1960, it was pretty much fully developed as it is today.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2021/02/17/5-things-that-you-didnt-know-about-north-balwyn","relative_path":"_posts/2021-02-18-5-things-that-you-didnt-know-about-north-balwyn.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Mapping"],"layout":"post","id":3310,"title":"Who still uses a Melway?","date":"2021-04-07 16:30:00 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=3310","auto_update_uri":["1"],"image":"/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/melwaycrop.jpg","tags":["Melway"],"slug":"who-still-uses-a-melway","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p>Next month, the iconic <a href=\"http://melway.com.au/\">Melway street director</a>y will celebrate its 55th anniversary.

Despite the almost total shift of casual map use from paper to digital access, this uniquely Melbourne map has continued to operate and bring joy to its users to this day.</p>\n\n<p>A recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dmejiacanales/status/1378518650068463617\">post on Twitter</a> about this date created a lot of discussion. Many were surprised that Melway is still around or predicting its imminent demise. I, for one, believe that Melway is here to stay for a while longer yet. It has managed to adapt well to rapidly changing circumstances and find niches in the market that continue to make it a viable operation.</p>\n\n<p>But that’s not what I want to talk about here.</p>\n\n<p>Coming back to the Twitter post, there were those expressing surprise and asking rhetorical questions like “who on Earth still uses Melways [sic]?”. This got me thinking about where they are still in use.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought is the popular Travelsmart maps published by local governments across Melbourne. These are basically maps of each municipality with a Melway background but with walking, cycling and public transport options emphasised. 25 metropolitan and three regional councils have current editions, along with four universities. A list of these is published on the <a href=\"https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/traffic-and-road-use/cycling/bicycle-route-maps\">VicRoads website here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Another recent example is related to the resurgence of another map-based information source. The ‘Civic Guides’ boards used to be a common site across Victoria. However, many of them fell into disrepair or were removed as the digital age supposedly rendered them obsolete. They seem to have been making a comeback over the past few years, albeit with a redesign emphasising advertising over map information, but they do still use a Melway map to display the local area.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/49749122602/\" title=\"Civic Guide at Heidelberg Station\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49749122602_4a2821d20a.jpg\" alt=\"Civic Guide at Heidelberg Station\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>Its unrivalled accuracy and comprehensive detail also makes it very useful for government applications. Even the Victorian Government’s <a href=\"https://www.delwp.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0031/49774/VicmapIndex_v4-1_Web-.pdf\">online VicMap portal</a> has Melway maps licensed as a data layer (for internal users only). I personally know of many local and state government offices with printed Melway maps hanging on the wall. At my work, we have both a wall map and street directory – both heavily used and annotated.</p>\n\n<p>You will still see ‘Melway reference’ used in some event or community facility descriptions to direct users to a location. This will be a page number and grid reference (e.g. ‘Melway(s) reference 15 F5). I’ve always loved the idea of this as a kind of secret code for Melburnians. If you don’t have a Melway, you have no idea where that could be!</p>\n\n<p>This is not an exhaustive list by any stretch of the imagination; just a select few that I want to highlight.</p>\n\n<p>Where have you seen a Melway map used recently? Feel free to drop a comment below!</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in more about the history of Melway, have a look at their <a href=\"https://www.melway.com.au/pages/melway-history\">website here</a> or <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-melways-is-turning-50-but-will-melbournes-backseat-bible-survive-the-gps-20160413-go5cvn.html\">this article from <em>The Age</em></a> on their 50th anniversary in 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Long live the Melway!</p>\n","url":"/blog/2021/04/07/who-still-uses-a-melway","relative_path":"_posts/2021-04-08-who-still-uses-a-melway.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport"],"layout":"post","id":3102,"title":"A funny thing happened on my way to the city","date":"2021-04-28 16:00:00 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=3102","slide_template":["default"],"rs_page_bg_color":["#ffffff"],"auto_update_uri":["1"],"image":"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Bfqrj6TCEAEZh4D.jpg","slug":"a-funny-thing-happened-on-my-way-to-the-city","ext":".md","tags":[],"excerpt":"<p>Anyone who takes public transport has their own weird and wonderful stories about things they have seen.

Nobody seemed to really notice until the cockatoo started to get a bit restless and started making some noise.</p>\n\n<p>It then started hopping around, testing out people’s shoulders for levels of comfort. The bird was very friendly and enjoyed looking out the window at passing trees.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"lost-on-the-207\">Lost on the 207</h4>\n\n<p>In my uni days, the 207 bus was my way to get to campus (it was also the 203/205 for a little while, <a href=\"https://busaustralia.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=78313\">may they RIP</a>).</p>\n\n<p>During one trip, there was a route diversion from Johnston Street. The bus driver was trying to make his way onto Lygon Street but got lost in the maze of Fitzroy’s side streets. He must have been a new driver, at least to the route, because he couldn’t find the right way back.</p>\n\n<p>When it became apparent to the passengers that he was going the wrong way, a couple of us got out of our seats and helped him find the way back. He was very apologetic but nobody minded. Everyone thanked him as they disembarked later.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"turning-left-into-hoddle-street\">Turning left into Hoddle Street</h4>\n\n<p>Speaking of Johnston Street buses, there was an ongoing interesting occurrence on the 203 when it was still around.</p>\n\n<p>Before the 2014 service changes, there were five different bus routes along Johnston Street (200, 201, 203, 205, 207). All of them went along Studley Park Road to Kew Junction except for the 203 which turned left at Hoddle Street and ran express down the Eastern Freeway to the Chandler Highway.</p>\n\n<p>Almost every time I caught this bus on my way home and it turned into Hoddle Street, there would be at least one person who would notice this and frantically get up and press the stop button and/or walk to the front and ask the driver where the bus was going. Some would get unjustifiably angry (which is never an acceptabled response), but most just accepted their fate and glumly sat back down.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"train-driver-making-a-delay-more-tolerable\">Train driver making a delay more tolerable</h4>\n\n<p>During a delay approaching Flinders Street Station on the Lilydale Line, we had been stationary outside our platform for at least 3-4 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>The train driver had been giving us what updates he could. But as this was taking some time he decided to offer some more useful information over the train’s PA system. I don’t know where he got them from but he started reading recipes for different dishes and drinks.</p>\n\n<p>The first one I think was for a chocolate milkshake and I can’t remember the rest, but it definitely made the disruption more interesting than usual.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"translation-at-victoria-park\">Translation at Victoria Park</h4>\n\n<p>I was waiting a the bus stop on a Sunday morning at Victoria Park Station in Abbotsford during one of my interchanges onto the 207 bus.</p>\n\n<p>While I was standing there watching the traffic go by (a pastime that’s an acquired taste, mainly among transport planners), three elderly women entirely dressed in black approached the stop. They began inspecting the timetable and speaking in Greek, trying to work out when their bus was arriving.</p>\n\n<p>Then one of them turned to me and asked in very heavily-accented English if I knew when the next bus would come. I checked the PTV app on my phone and replied in Greek that it would here in a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Her eyes lit up and exclaimed to her friends that there was someone who could help and spoke Greek. And so began about a 10 minute conversation with them, both waiting for and on board the bus. This was in April just before Greek Easter and they had been to church for their morning service.</p>\n\n<p>They got off the bus just before it entered Kew (a lot of Greeks still live in Collingwood and Abbotsford, although not as many as there used to be). Unfortunately for me, I made a pretty bad slip up.</p>\n\n<p>For Greek Easter, in the days leading up to the big day of Easter Sunday, you say ‘Καλό Πάσχα’ (Happy Easter). A couple of days before Easter Sunday, you can say ‘Καλή Ανάσταση’ (Happy Resurrection). You are only supposed to say ‘Χριστός Ανέστη’ (Christ is Risen) on Easter Sunday itself.</p>\n\n<p>It was at least a week before Easter Sunday but I said ‘Χριστός Ανέστη’ to them as they left the bus. They kept saying ‘Καλό Πάσχα’ back to me but I didn’t get the hint until later that day when the penny dropped.</p>\n\n<p>A slightly long and marginally relevant tangent but there you go. It was nice to have a chat with some random people in Greek. It’s not something that happens every day.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"bruce-the-tram-driver\">Bruce the tram driver</h4>\n\n<p>And of course, who could forget <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/melbournes-happiest-tram-driver-brings-joy-and-connection-to-the-daily-grind-20160123-gmclcl.html\">Bruce the friendly tram driver</a>? He’s well known to regular passengers on the Kew Depot routes (48 and 109) but apparently he’s also been driving on others recently as well.</p>\n\n<p>I remember speaking to him a couple of times or otherwise being a passenger on one of his trams, which were always interesting experiences. Once he sang Happy Birthday to You over the tram intercom after overhearing someone mention that it was their birthday. And then there’s his regular jokes about the “world’s longest tram platform” at Jolimont Station and about Richmond supporters as he enters Bridge Road.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2021/04/28/a-funny-thing-happened-on-my-way-to-the-city","relative_path":"_posts/2021-04-29-a-funny-thing-happened-on-my-way-to-the-city.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport"],"layout":"post","id":3400,"title":"The most and least punctual bus routes in Melbourne","date":"2021-07-18 17:00:00 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=3400","header_position":["inherit"],"header_fullwidth":["inherit"],"page_header_styling":["inherit"],"heading_title":["0"],"custom_logo":[""],"custom_logo_width":[""],"custom_menu_skin":["default"],"sticky_menu_on_page":["default"],"custom_sticky_logo":[""],"sticky_menu_skin":["default"],"section_logo_switch":["0"],"footer_visibility":["inherit"],"fixed_footer":["inherit"],"footer_fullwidth":["inherit"],"custom_grid_container_width":["0"],"breadcrumb":["inherit"],"featured_image_placing":["hide"],"post_image_size":["inherit"],"page_custom_css":[""],"auto_update_uri":["1"],"image":"/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50284007992_e0c8320790_c.jpg","tags":["Bus data","Data"],"slug":"the-most-and-least-punctual-bus-routes-in-melbourne","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p><em>See the data <a href=\"https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMzE2ZDIyN2YtODY1Yy00ZGY0LWE4YTktNDcxOTcwYWQyMjM5IiwidCI6IjcyMmVhMGJlLTNlMWMtNGIxMS1hZDZmLTk0MDFkNjg1NmUyNCJ9\">here</a>.</em></p>\n","content":"<p><em>See the data <a href=\"https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMzE2ZDIyN2YtODY1Yy00ZGY0LWE4YTktNDcxOTcwYWQyMjM5IiwidCI6IjcyMmVhMGJlLTNlMWMtNGIxMS1hZDZmLTk0MDFkNjg1NmUyNCJ9\">here</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/new-public-data-reveals-high-performing-bus-network\">Friday last week</a>, the Department of Transport added metropolitan bus performance data to its monthly public transport reporting. This is exciting news as it was not previously publicly available.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50284007992_e0c8320790_c.jpg)</figure>\n<p>The data is not very easy to find.</p>\n\n<p>To get there, you have to visit ptv.vic.gov.au, scroll to the bottom of the page, click on ‘Data and Reporting’, click on ‘<a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/data-and-reporting/network-performance/monthly-performance/\">Monthly performance</a>‘ and then scroll to nearly the bottom of the page to find a link buried in some text: “For detailed punctuality, reliability, and services monitored<a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/data-and-reporting/network-performance/monthly-performance/#ServicesMonitored\"><sup><em>(1)</em></sup></a> information, <a href=\"https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMzE2ZDIyN2YtODY1Yy00ZGY0LWE4YTktNDcxOTcwYWQyMjM5IiwidCI6IjcyMmVhMGJlLTNlMWMtNGIxMS1hZDZmLTk0MDFkNjg1NmUyNCJ9\">see our Power BI App</a>“</p>\n\n<p>There is a lot of information to digest in this Power BI table. Unfortunately, it’s not available to download, so the general public are quite limited in the type and scope of analysis that is practically possible. It is also only available back to July 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these constraints, we can still pull out some interesting findings.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"covid-19-has-significantly-improved-average-mean-bus-punctuality\">COVID-19 has significantly improved average (mean) bus punctuality</h4>\n\n<p>In 2019, mean bus punctuality across the network was 86.8%. In 2020, this shot up by more than eight per cent to 92.9%.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/buspatronage.png)</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>This was likely due to the <a href=\"https://chartingtransport.com/2020/05/03/what-impact-has-the-2020-covid-19-pandemic-had-on-road-traffic-volumes-in-victoria/\" title=\"https://chartingtransport.com/2020/05/03/what-impact-has-the-2020-covid-19-pandemic-had-on-road-traffic-volumes-in-victoria/\">significant decrease</a> in motor vehicle traffic across Melbourne and Victoria throughout most of 2020 due to lockdown restrictions on movement. Less road traffic means fewer delays to buses caused by motor vehicles (crashes, congestion, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Lower passenger numbers may have also played a part. This may have been by reducing the number of stops that buses needed to make and speeding up journey times.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"buses-are-most-punctual-in-january-and-least-punctual-in-march\">Buses are most punctual in January and least punctual in March</h4>\n\n<p>Under non-COVID conditions (looking at 2018-2019 data), mean bus punctuality across the network varied quite considerably between months.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, if you look at it month-by-month, January had the highest percentage of on-time services. March had the lowest percentage of on-time services, closely followed by February.</p>\n\n<p>This is probably the impact of school holidays and the resulting decrease in motor vehicle traffic that usually causes delays to bus services.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-best-performing-bus-routes-tend-to-be-very-short-and--or-infrequent\">The best-performing bus routes tend to be very short and / or infrequent</h4>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I can’t link route length data to punctuality information as the Power BI tables cannot be downloaded. So this is more off my general observations rather than many hard stats.</p>\n\n<p>You can sort routes by punctuality, and it seems that those that perform the best are those with short routes or infrequent service patterns.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\">| Route | % On Time (July 2017 – June 2021) | 2018-19 Patronage |\n|---|---|---|\n| 444 | 99.8% | N/A |\n| 786 | 98.8% | 2,630 |\n| 489 | 98.5% | 85,348 |\n| 550 | 98.5% | 58,054 |\n| 486 | 98.4% | 137,572 |\n| 673 | 98.3% | 3,768 |\n| 487 | 97.8% | 67,063 |\n| 570 | 97.8% | 202,371 |\n| 696 | 97.8% | 2,231 |\n| 454 | 97.7% | N/A |\n\n</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>The most punctual bus route, the 444, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200320084725/https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/bus-boost-for-melton-rockbank-and-the-growing-west/\">is a new one</a>, having only commenced services in November 2019. It also travels only a short distance from Rockbank Station into the Aintree Estate with only eight stops.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the rest have been around for quite a while longer but they all fall into one of the two categories mentioned earlier. The <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/timetable/4663/786-rye-to-st-andrews-beach/#RoutePage:::datetime=2021-07-18T23%3A20%3A00.000Z&amp;direction_id=251&amp;stop_id=-1&amp;_auth=80619c3452fbe9ea11c487e2602aa8fef1a115ef6cd6c591dcc887fd57eaee1c\">786</a>, for example, only operates six services on weekdays plus three on Saturdays and carries a <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2020/02/28/melbourne-bus-route-patronage-data-for-2008-2019/\">tiny number of passengers</a> (2,630 in 2018-19), while the 696 (running from Olinda to Monbulk) only carried 2,231 passengers in 2018-19 along its nine stops.</p>\n\n<p>Three of the top ten (489, 486 and 487) operate in Sunbury and are presumably less likely to be affected by motor vehicle delays due to the lower levels of traffic.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/11118/570-thomastown-rmit-bundoora/\">570</a> is an interesting one. My two thoughts on this are that it is a relatively short route and also passes directly past the Dyson’s bus depot in Bundoora, making it very quick and easy for buses to start or end their trips. If you have any other theories or ideas as to why this comes up as the eighth most-punctual bus route in Melbourne, please let me know in the comments below.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\">| Route | % On Time (July 2017 – June 2021) | 2018-19 Patronage |\n|---|---|---|\n| 606 | 69.1% | 128,113 |\n| 182 | 70.9% | N/A |\n| 417 | 72.4% | 34,567 |\n| 219 | 73.8% | 335,909 |\n| 538 | 74.8% | 38,533 |\n| 546 | 75.4% | 206,071 |\n| 693 | 76.8% | 438,186 |\n| 795 | 77.2% | 13,673 |\n| 350 | 77.7% | 199,586 |\n| 232 | 79.2% | 180,196 |\n| 303 | 79.2% | 68,530 |\n\n</figure>\n<hr />\n\n<p>The top 10 least punctual routes are a bit more of a mixed bag. It includes a new route (182, which hasn’t been operating for even six months yet) and some old, well-established routes like the 219.</p>\n\n<p>It’s less clear to me why these particular routes are in the top 10, other than they all have significant lengths of their route on roads that get quite congested. Again if you have any ideas, please let me know in the comments.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>It’s important to remember how this data is compiled and presented. There are a lot of qualifications. For example, ‘on time’ is defined by DoT for buses as: <em>“Number of services arriving no more than 4 minutes and 59 seconds late and departing no more than 59 seconds early at timing points.”</em></p>\n\n<p>There is more information on this in the first three tabs of the Power BI dashboard if you are interested.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve barely scratched the surface for the potential of this great dataset. For example, I would love to link this data to others that include bus patronage, route length and number of stops to cross-tabulate and analyse this information. But as I mentioned above, this is impossible unless the data is able to be downloaded in a machine-readable format (at least as far as I’m aware).</p>\n\n<p>I may come back to this topic soon after I’ve had some more time to dig around and cross-reference to related datasets. I’m sure others will also be doing the same.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2021/07/18/the-most-and-least-punctual-bus-routes-in-melbourne","relative_path":"_posts/2021-07-19-the-most-and-least-punctual-bus-routes-in-melbourne.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport"],"layout":"post","id":3482,"title":"Railway station and tram stop patronage in Victoria for 2008-2021","date":"2022-03-08 19:00:00 -0600","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=3482","header_position":["inherit"],"header_fullwidth":["inherit"],"page_header_styling":["inherit"],"heading_title":["0"],"custom_logo":[""],"custom_logo_width":[""],"custom_menu_skin":["default"],"sticky_menu_on_page":["default"],"custom_sticky_logo":[""],"sticky_menu_skin":["default"],"section_logo_switch":["0"],"footer_visibility":["inherit"],"fixed_footer":["inherit"],"footer_fullwidth":["inherit"],"custom_grid_container_width":["0"],"breadcrumb":["inherit"],"featured_image_placing":["default"],"post_image_size":["inherit"],"related_posts_visibility":["inherit"],"page_custom_css":[""],"slug":"railway-station-and-tram-stop-patronage-in-victoria-for-2008-2021","ext":".md","tags":[],"excerpt":"<p>Good news!

Amongst other things, it’s caused significant variances in public transport use due to lockdowns, travel restrictions, working from home and many other things.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, I am going to answer this question on the least and most used stations in Victoria in two sections. The first will be using the last complete yearly data before COVID-19 hit us, i.e. 2018-19. The second will be using 2020-21 data, which is the latest available. I’ll do this in a separate post.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-least-used-station-in-victoria-pre-covid\">The least used station in Victoria (pre-COVID)</h2>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, this uses 2018-19 data.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps no surprise, as last time, that all of the ten least used stations in Victoria are in regional areas.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\">| Rank | Station | Patronage (yearly) | Line |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Dingee | 400 | Swan Hill |\n| 2 | Talbot | 1000 | Maryborough |\n| 3 | Elmore | 1200 | Echuca |\n| 4 | Creswick | 1350 | Maryborough |\n| 5 | Springhurst | 1500 | Albury |\n| 6 | Avenel | 1850 | Albury |\n| 7 | Sherwood Park | 1900 | Warrnambool |\n| 8 | Clunes | 2200 | Maryborough |\n| 9 | Rosedale | 2550 | Bairnsdale |\n| 10 | Eaglehawk | 2700 | Swan Hill |\n\n</figure>\n<p>Dingee takes out the title of the least used station in Victoria for 2018-19 with approximately 400 people per year. This is a little more than one person per day. In 2016-17, we had Elmore down as the least used station. However, for some reason, Dingee was not included in pre-2018 data, so it may also have been at this time too.</p>\n\n<p>On the electrified metropolitan network, this was the picture in 2018-19 (excludes the Stony Point Line, which easily make up the ten by themselves):</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\">| Rank | Station | Patronage (yearly) | Line |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Wattle Glen | 48,050 | Hurstbridge |\n| 2 | Tecoma | 75,650 | Belgrave |\n| 3 | Willison | 102,600 | Alamein |\n| 4 | Seaholme | 106,850 | Werribee |\n| 5 | Officer | 122,900 | Pakenham |\n| 6 | Hurstbridge | 123,150 | Hurstbridge |\n| 7 | Alamein | 145,700 | Alamein |\n| 8 | Darebin | 150,400 | Hurstbridge |\n| 9 | Upwey | 157,050 | Belgrave |\n| 10 | Rushall | 158,350 | Mernda |\n\n</figure>\n<p>This is a similar picture to 2016-17. Some of the changes are that Diggers Rest is no longer in the least used 10 (patronage shot up to 221,250), being replaced by Rushall. Officer has also risen from third least used to fifth least used with a significant increase in yearly patronage – likely due to suburban expansion in the area.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-most-used-station-in-victoria-pre-covid\">The most used station in Victoria (pre-COVID)</h2>\n\n<p>On the metropolitan network, these came up as the top ten in 2018-19:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\">| Rank | Station | Patronage (yearly) | Line |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Flinders Street | 28,320,650 | Multiple |\n| 2 | Southern Cross | 19,551,450 | Multiple |\n| 3 | Melbourne Central | 15,250,700 | Multiple |\n| 4 | Parliament | 10,124,200 | Multiple |\n| 5 | Footscray | 5,332,950 | Multiple |\n| 6 | Flagstaff | 4,854,950 | Multiple |\n| 7 | South Yarra | 4,367,150 | Multiple |\n| 8 | Richmond | 4,227,000 | Multiple |\n| 9 | Caulfield | 4,175,050 | Multiple |\n| 10 | Box Hill | 3,685,500 | Belgrave/Lilydale |\n\n</figure>\n<p>Not many surprises here – Flinders Street easily takes the title of most used station in the state. The stations here are the same as 2016-17 with just some slight changes in order.</p>\n\n<p>The data notes indicate that interchanges within stations are not counted in these figures. The Southern Cross Station figure also excludes V/Line data from Platforms 1-8.</p>\n\n<p>For regional stations:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\">| Rank | Station | Patronage (yearly) | Line |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Southern Cross | 6,306,000 | Multiple |\n| 2 | Tarneit | 1,350,500 | Geelong |\n| 3 | Geelong | 844,050 | Geelong |\n| 4 | Melton | 827,850 | Ballarat |\n| 5 | Wyndham Vale | 786,100 | Geelong |\n| 6 | Ballarat | 624,050 | Ballarat |\n| 7 | South Geelong | 557,400 | Geelong |\n| 8 | Deer Park | 453,950 | Ballarat/Geelong |\n| 9 | Bendigo | 437,100 | Bendigo |\n| 10 | Lara | 383,900 | Geelong |\n\n</figure>\n<p>This one has quite a few more differences.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing to note is Tarneit Station, which has jumped from 887,566 in 2016-17 to 1,350,500 in just two years. This may be the first time that a non-interchange V/Line station in Victoria has cracked a million passengers (please correct me if I’m wrong).</p>\n\n<p>Other things to note are that Footscray has completely fallen off the charts from the 2016-17 data. I suspect this is because V/Line were previously including interchange data in their figures. Otherwise, the most used stations continue to be mostly located in major regional cities and growth areas in metropolitan Melbourne.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>So that’s all for now!

This is a less than one person per day.</p>\n\n<p>On the electrified metropolitan network, this was the picture in 2018-19 (excludes the Stony Point Line, which easily make up the ten by themselves, and Showgrounds/Flemington Racecourse as special event stations):</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\">| Rank | Station | Patronage (yearly) | Line |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Wattle Glen | 16,600 | Hurstbridge |\n| 2 | Tecoma | 30,300 | Belgrave |\n| 3 | Willison | 32,400 | Alamein |\n| 4 | Seaholme | 39,900 | Werribee |\n| 5 | Alamein | 46,350 | Alamein |\n| 6 | Hurstbridge | 50,350 | Hurstbridge |\n| 7 | Eaglemont | 50,550 | Hurstbridge |\n| 8 | Darebin | 53,850 | Hurstbridge |\n| 9 | Diggers Rest | 59,350 | Sunbury |\n| 10 | Upwey | 61,700 | Belgrave |\n\n</figure>\n<p>This is a similar picture to 2018-19. However, what I think is interesting is that Officer – normally a regular feature in these least used station lists – is not in the top ten. Diggers Rest and Eaglemont also feature here and not in 2018-19. This probably has something to do with commuting patterns and working from home.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-most-used-station-in-victoria-during-covid\">The most used station in Victoria (during COVID)</h2>\n\n<p>On the metropolitan network, these came up as the top ten in 2020-21:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\">| Rank | Station | Patronage (yearly) | Line |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Flinders Street | 8,528,000 | Multiple |\n| 2 | Southern Cross | 4,556,450 | Multiple |\n| 3 | Melbourne Central | 4,206,700 | Multiple |\n| 4 | Parliament | 2,213,650 | Multiple |\n| 5 | Footscray | 2,056,000 | Multiple |\n| 6 | South Yarra | 1,669,900 | Multiple |\n| 7 | Flagstaff | 1,378,000 | Multiple |\n| 8 | Caulfield | 1,370,650 | Multiple |\n| 9 | Richmond | 1,292,650 | Multiple |\n| 10 | Box Hill | 1,192,700 | Belgrave/Lilydale |\n\n</figure>\n<p>Again, not many surprises here – Flinders Street easily takes the title of most used station in the state. The stations here are the same as 2018-19 with just some slight changes in order.</p>\n\n<p>The data notes indicate that interchanges within stations are not counted in these figures. The Southern Cross Station figure also excludes V/Line data from Platforms 1-8.</p>\n\n<p>For regional stations:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\">| Rank | Station | Patronage (yearly) | Line |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Southern Cross | 2,033,750 | Multiple |\n| 2 | Tarneit | 593,000 | Geelong |\n| 3 | Wyndham Vale | 358,050 | Geelong |\n| 4 | Geelong | 336,000 | Geelong |\n| 5 | Melton | 326,100 | Ballarat |\n| 6 | Deer Park | 240,650 | Ballarat/Geelong |\n| 7 | Ballarat | 179,500 | Ballarat |\n| 8 | South Geelong | 162,000 | Geelong |\n| 9 | Bendigo | 157,700 | Bendigo |\n| 10 | Lara | 147,800 | Geelong |\n\n</figure>\n<p>As with the metropolitan network, this ranking is more or less the same. Deer Park and Wyndham Vale jumped up a few places, pushing more regional stations like Ballarat and Bendigo further down.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"impacts-of-covid-19\">Impacts of COVID-19</h2>\n\n<p>Since we’re talking about the COVID pandemic, let’s have a quick look at what it has done to patronage by station.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the yearly patronage difference between 2018-19 and 2020-21 was a 66% decrease for the metropolitan network. By station, we can get a more granular picture of what’s happening. Here are the top ten largest declines (as a percentage) for stations in Melbourne on the metropolitan network:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\">| Rank | Station | Patronage difference 2018-19 to 2020-21 (yearly) | Line |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Showgrounds | -98% | Flemington Racecourse |\n| 2 | Flemington Racecourse | -88% | Flemington Racecourse |\n| 3 | Coburg | -80% | Upfield |\n| 4 | Parliament | -78% | Multiple |\n| 5 | Aircraft | -77% | Werribee |\n| 6 | Southern Cross | -77% | Multiple |\n| 7 | Williams Landing | -77% | Werribee |\n| 8 | Moreland | -76% | Upfield |\n| 9 | East Malvern | -73% | Glen Waverley |\n| 10 | Diggers Rest | -73% | Sunbury |\n\n</figure>\n<p>There are a lot of interesting things going on here.</p>\n\n<p>The first two – Showgrounds and Flemington Racecourse – operate during special events. Obviously during COVID-19 restrictions, these events did not operate, or operated without spectators (e.g. the 2020 Melbourne Cup).</p>\n\n<p>Some of the stations on this list were affected by works and were partially or fully closed for long periods of time. Coburg and Moreland were closed as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project, as was Aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>Parliament was a bit of a surprise for me. Obviously the City Loop stations were seriously impacted by not having office workers commuting to the CBD for most of this year, but I did not expect it to be this significant. In total numbers, it’s almost eight million fewer people using the station than before COVID.</p>\n\n<p>This would also be the main reason why Southern Cross is also on this list, but not the only one. This station is also the main hub for regional trains, which would also account for the nearly 15 million fewer boardings than 2018-19.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we have two odd ones out – East Malvern and Williams Landing. Neither of these stations serve activity centres and are primarily used for commuting which, for many people, was not happening during the pandemic.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>So that’s all for now!

But recent events at Twitter have finally pushed me to take action on the social media front.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-mastodon\">What is Mastodon?</h2>\n\n<p>Mastodon is a free and open source <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging\">microblogging</a> platform. Its concept is similar to Twitter but different in execution.</p>\n\n<p>While Twitter is a single corporation owned and controlled by a few people (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation\">most recently, just one</a>), Mastodon is a piece of software that is decentralised across thousands of different servers.</p>\n\n<p>Does this mean that each server operates separately? Well, not really.</p>\n\n<p>While each installation of Mastodon may have its own rules and policies, they are all part of the same platform. Users of any Mastodon server (or ‘Instance’) can follow, reply and otherwise interact with users of any other – provided that they are public ones of course.</p>\n\n<p>There is no background algorithm or other ways to manipulate what you do or see. Content is displayed chronologically with a lot of options to customise things as you wish.</p>\n\n<p>One final benefit is that it also gives you access to other <a href=\"https://jointhefedi.com\">Fediverse</a> apps and websites. These include a range of software for alternatives to Youtube, Instagram and other closed-source social media. If you want to know more about this check out <a href=\"https://joinfediverse.wiki/What_is_the_Fediverse%3F\">this page</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-join-mastodon\">How do I join Mastodon?</h2>\n\n<p>Even as someone who had never really looked at Mastodon properly before this week, I found the process relatively easy.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing to do is select an Instance. You can do this by visiting this website which will help you choose. Otherwise the most common option is to join <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/explore\">mastodon.social</a> – the largest one at the time of writing. If you’re in Australia you can sign up to <a href=\"https://aus.social/\">aus.social</a> as an alternative (the one that I have joined).</p>\n\n<p>The important thing to note here is that it doesn’t really matter which one you choose. As I said before, you can interact with other users on any other Instance and you can even move to another one if you want. Just keep an eye on data privacy and social policies and you’ll be good to go.</p>\n\n<p>Once you pick an instance, it’s straightforward. Pick an email, account name and all of the other usual things.</p>\n\n<p>You will end up with a profile and home page – similar to Twitter – that you can customise as much or little as you want. The number of options to make it your own are much better than those on Twitter. For example, you can add custom links to your profile and add featured hashtags or accounts to the sidebar.</p>\n\n<p>The interface will look something like this:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mastodonhome-1024x660.png)</figure>\n<h2 id=\"what-if-i-want-to-use-twitter\">What if I want to use Twitter?</h2>\n\n<p>It’s entirely up to you how much, or if, you migrate over to Mastodon.</p>\n\n<p>While recent events have boosted user numbers, it is still just a small proportion of Twitter’s <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/303681/twitter-users-worldwide/\">340 million</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I plan to use both Twitter and Mastodon for the time being. I am going to play around with a <a href=\"https://edtechfactotum.com/cross-posting-from-mastodon-to-twitter-using-ifttt-and-rss/\">small script in IFTTT</a> that automatically posts between my accounts as well.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gunzel-city-and-similar-accounts-to-follow\">Gunzel, city and similar accounts to follow</h2>\n\n<p>To help make the transition a bit easier, I have started a list of accounts that are related to various topics around transport, cities, planning, etc. that you may be interested in following.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I have created a Mastodon list here: <a href=\"https://philam.github.io/movetomastodon/\">https://philam.github.io/movetomastodon/</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>These are not comprehensive and as more people make the journey across, I have no doubt that there will be many more.

But every once in a while, something happens that brings me rushing back to my WordPress dashboard.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-trip\">The trip</h2>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago I had reason to head up the Hurstbridge Line on a social visit. I arrived at Jolimont Station to catch the 5:15pm Eltham train.</p>\n\n<p>After waiting for about 20 minutes, I noticed that the platform screen had been showing the next train arriving “in 2 minutes” for a lot longer than just 2 minutes. It then suddenly disappeared without explanation.</p>\n\n<p>There was no information about anything abnormal at the station. In the absence of this, I called PTV to see what was happening. The operator told me that the 5:15pm train would be arriving in 10 minutes or so and everything was fine. I asked her to double check because I hadn’t seen a train in a while, but she assured me that trains were running – it was just a bit late.</p>\n\n<p>Immediately after finishing the call, I checked the Metro Trains Twitter account which, funnily enough, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metrotrains/status/1589140420331986944\">had just tweeted</a> that a truck had hit the rail bridge on Elizabeth Street in North Richmond.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mtmtwitter.png)</figure>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<p>Some Authorised Officers (AOs) had arrived on the platform for unrelated reasons, so I decided to ask them what was going on. They told me that trains were still running. Then one of them got a call saying that all trains on the Mernda/Hurstbridge Line were suspended and that it would be at least 40-50 minutes before an engineer could be brought out to inspect the bridge.</p>\n\n<p>At this point there were no Metro Trains staff that I could see, nothing showing on information screens and only one muffled announcement that I apparently missed because the only speaker on Platform 2 is located directly above its main entrance and I was standing a bit further down.</p>\n\n<p>The AOs advised me to find another way to continue my journey, which definitely seemed like a good idea given the 40-50 minute timeframe.</p>\n\n<p>So what other way was there?</p>\n\n<p>There is a stop for the Route 246 bus on Punt Road nearby. It’s about a 5-6 minute walk away. This bus runs parallel to the railway up to Clifton Hill. But I only just happen to know this because I’m a gunzel and a transport planner. There was no guidance from any official source, other than the Metro Trains Twitter account advising people to catch the Route 12 or 109 trams. This is useful if you’re trying to get to North Richmond from the CBD, but not for getting anywhere else along the Mernda/Hurstbridge Lines.</p>\n\n<p>I hopped on the 246 within a few minutes of arriving at the stop – which was luckily running late due to traffic. The journey north was fine. But what I saw at each bus stop outside the stations as we continued north was an increasing number of people waiting. About 20 people boarded at West and North Richmond, looking for an alternative route. Many of the other people at the bus stop were waiting for taxis, rideshare or other transport.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_20221106_173325_829-1024x576.jpg)</figure>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<p>As with my experience, none of the people who boarded had received any information on how to get to their destination. Overhearing this, I helped them out with their journey planning – asking them where they were going and offering suggestions. For example, a woman with her son and another couple were looking to get to Northcote near Dennis Station. I suggested the 246 to Clifton Hill Interchange and change to the Route 250 or 251 bus up Victoria Road. Another woman who boarded at Victoria Park wanted to get to the city – I suggested that she catch the 86 tram.</p>\n\n<p>But the true scale of the disruption wasn’t truly apparent until we approached Clifton Hill Station. The scene that greeted us as we passed by was crowds of hundreds of people on both sides of Hoddle Street waiting for taxis, rideshare, buses or whatever other alternative transport they could find. It was quite an incredible sight.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_20221106_174240_876-1024x576.jpg)</figure>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_20221106_174244_729-1024x576.jpg)</figure>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<p>Of course, this was all exacerbated by the fact that there was a major cricket match being held at the MCG, with many patrons trying to get there by train. I can’t imagine that this experience would make many of them want to try public transport again next time.</p>\n\n<p>By this time, I was on the phone again to PTV to ask whether or not trains were running beyond Clifton Hill. If they were, I could get off the bus earlier to continue my journey. By this time, we were well into 30+ minutes of the disruption. There was no information on the PTV app or website and there had been no further updates or information on social media.</p>\n\n<p>The operator who took my call was very nice and tried her best to be helpful. But when I asked for this information, she told me that she wasn’t aware of any disruption. Her information showed a “good service” running on the Mernda/Hurstbridge Lines with no suspensions or delays. As a result, despite her best efforts, she was unable to help me. She offered to put me through to another area to put in a complaint, but this didn’t work properly and I was cut off. Again, not a great passenger experience.</p>\n\n<p>In the end trains began running again after about 30-35 minutes – with delays – and services began to slowly return to normal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-ways-to-fix-it\">The ways to fix it</h2>\n\n<p>Disruptions happen. Things break. I entirely understand that. There are always things beyond the control of transport authorities and operators.</p>\n\n<p>But what <strong>is</strong> within their control is how disruptions are managed.</p>\n\n<p>The first, and easiest, thing to fix is providing information to passengers.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout this entire period, I never saw any disruption information on station platform screens. Departure times for the next train continued to count down but trains never arrived. The single announcement of which I was aware reached only some people on platforms, as the range and placement of speakers meant that you could only hear it if you were standing directly underneath them. As a result, only about two of the 25 people waiting at Jolimont actually heard anything.</p>\n\n<p>When I was on the 246 bus, the 20 or so people who I helped out only received that information because I happened to be there. If I wasn’t there, who knows when or if these people would have found a way, or if they would have just given up and waited for a taxi or rideshare to pick them up. This could have been easily avoided with clear and timely information provided by PTV/Metro Trains. This could have been in the form of platform announcements, station staff talking to passengers (where available), social media and on the PTV website/app.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone from PTV or Metro Trains is reading, here is another easy idea for you.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s have some prepared alternative transport information that is ready to go when disruptions happen. As there are only some places where trains can operate in sections, it would be easy to identify these options for each one. Then there could be some documentation that is ready to be published by station staff and through announcements, as well as on the PTV website, app and social media channels immediately when a disruption happens in one of these sections. This saves staff scrambling around trying to find this and significantly reduces the likelihood that incorrect or impractical information is published.</p>\n\n<p>This can also be used to have permanent posters with specific information. I’ve done a quick example below of what an improvement could look like in the form of posters at a station (which would be displayed in addition to the station maps, not as a substitute).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">[![](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/alternativetransportexample-1-724x1024.png)](https://philipmallis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/alternativetransportexample-1.png)</figure>\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"></div>\n<p>Compare this to the new maps and disruption information boards that have been recently installed below.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/51962762922/\" title=\"Footscray Station precinct map on Platform 5, Footscray\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51962762922_d229e97d83_c.jpg\" alt=\"Footscray Station precinct map on Platform 5, Footscray\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>&lt;div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Leaving aside the issues with the maps which I will leave for a separate post, see the small box in the bottom right hand corner euphemistically titled “Changes to your service”.</p>\n\n<p>This is a great illustration of one of the key issues. There is nothing here on how someone might find an alternative route on regular public transport. Even in a place like Footscray which has many feasible options, the only real information is for the location of train replacement buses. This may not be applicable in many situations (such as my example above) or even the best option for passengers.</p>\n\n<p>While it is certainly an improvement from the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/51352425628/\">older style maps</a> which usually just ignored regular buses entirely, these newer ones frankly don’t do much better. There are some better examples – <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/49053589722/\">such as at Reservoir</a> – but these appear to be bespoke and not included at most stations. Plus, again, they aren’t very useful for helping people find alternative routes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-conclusion\">The conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>As I said before, it is not unusual for things to disrupt public transport. In fact, we know with certainty that it will happen. When and where is another matter, but we can still get ready. For example, having pre-prepared content with alternative transport options for sections of each railway line that can be immediately shared would be incredibly useful. Not only would it be much quicker to get this information to passengers, but it eliminates or greatly reduces the possibility of publishing vague, incomplete or impractical advice (as has happened an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yarratrams/status/1101366702951096320\">unfortunate</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bigbutchy21/status/1227713572551176192\">number of times</a> in the past).</p>\n\n<p>Postscript: after writing this post I noticed a good example from PTV and Yarra Trams that illustrates part of my point.

This creates bad experiences. We know this then leads to people avoiding public transport and perpetuates negative perceptions.</p>\n\n<p>There is a lot to talk about with this topic and I have <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2020/10/17/how-to-improve-ptv-disruption-information/\" title=\"How to improve PTV disruption information\">written</a> <a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2022/12/06/my-train-disruption-experience-and-how-to-make-it-better/\" title=\"My train disruption experience, and how to make it better\">before</a> about some of the many issues with the quality of information put out by PTV.</p>\n\n<p>This time I want to zoom in on bus stops.</p>\n\n<p>To cut a long story short, most bus stops in Melbourne used to contain maps of the local area.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/38216434455/\" title=\"Map of Brimbank public transport, Sunshine\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/4635/38216434455_8dd9612d3e_c.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Brimbank public transport, Sunshine\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>Then PTV began removing these from almost all bus stops. They were replaced with either nothing or advertising information – even when it was quite useless.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/49904706892/\" title=\"Bus stop with maps replaced by duplicate myki signs, Churchill\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49904706892_96f4fb5ffd_c.jpg\" alt=\"Bus stop with maps replaced by duplicate myki signs, Churchill\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>Some stops were lucky enough to get a schematic route diagram showing major stops. While this is better and does serve a purpose, it is not a map nor does it show nearly as much information as it did previously.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/51587219825/\" title=\"New style bus route diagram on 609 bus stop on Chandler Highway, Alphington\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51587219825_feb8e88b30_c.jpg\" alt=\"New style bus route diagram on 609 bus stop on Chandler Highway, Alphington\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>The only ones spared or refreshed were at some major interchanges. The few new maps that did go up were actually very good.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/43842372774/\" title=\"New Manningham bus network map at Doncaster Park and Ride\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/1885/43842372774_c1845d7d4a_c.jpg\" alt=\"New Manningham bus network map at Doncaster Park and Ride\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>While there was no public statement or information provided by PTV on this program, I can only assume that the reason for doing this was to reduce costs. Revising and replacing hundreds of local area maps across Melbourne would be time-consuming and need resources to complete.</p>\n\n<p>However, I would argue that this would be time and money well spent. There are many scenarios where a map on a bus stop would be useful. Tourists trying to orient themselves in a new area, less frequent passengers getting to their final destination, and people who are unable to use a phone to access digital information for whatever reason.</p>\n\n<p>I should add that this same scenario has played out at tram stops as well, with the same issues and drawbacks.</p>\n\n<p>The new maps implemented at major bus stops and interchanges show that the capability definitely exists within PTV to bring physical maps back to most, if not all stops. I understand that we need to spend time and money where it is most needed as well. But if we want more people to use public transport, then removing or degrading physical information is not going to help.</p>\n","url":"/blog/2023/01/30/removing-maps-from-bus-stops-and-the-digital-divide","relative_path":"_posts/2023-01-31-removing-maps-from-bus-stops-and-the-digital-divide.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":["Transport"],"layout":"post","id":3639,"title":"What is a 2 hour myki fare?","date":"2023-06-17 17:00:00 -0500","author":"Philip","guid":"https://philipmallis.com/?p=3639","image":"https://live.staticflickr.com/1744/42125384484_ea2d9b46f8.jpg","tags":["Melbourne","myki","PTV"],"slug":"what-is-a-2-hour-myki-fare","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p><a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki\">myki</a> has been in place as Melbourne’s public transport ticketing system for over a decade.

It has benefits and drawbacks that could take up space for many posts. But in this one I want to focus on answering one apparently difficult question – what exactly is a 2 hour myki fare?</p>\n\n<p>With myki, there are two fare types that you can use with ‘myki money’ – i.e. topping up as you go rather than purchasing a ticket for a fixed period. These are <strong>daily</strong> and <strong>2 hour</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This is calculated using the times when the system detects your myki card. With myki, you must touch on by tapping your card to a reader every time you start a trip. In most, but not all cases, you also need to touch off.</p>\n\n<p>When PTV introduced 2 hour fares as part of myki there was a grace period built in. This meant that your ticket would be valid for more than two hours – <a href=\"https://richardleonard.wordpress.com/2014/08/09/myki-how-to-make-the-most-of-the-new-2-hour-fare/\">sometimes up to almost three</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since August 2014, this has been changed to last exactly two hours.</p>\n\n<p>The confusion here mainly lies with when exactly this two hour period begins and ends.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipmallis/42125384484/\" title=\"New myki reader at Rosanna Station\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/1744/42125384484_ea2d9b46f8.jpg\" alt=\"New myki reader at Rosanna Station\" /></a><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\"></script>&lt;div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height:30px\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<a href=\"https://philipmallis.com/blog/2020/10/17/how-to-improve-ptv-disruption-information/\" title=\"How to improve PTV disruption information\">As usual</a>, the PTV website is of no help at all. In several places, it states conflicting, incorrect or confusing information when trying to explain. For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“2 hour myki money fare between where a customer boards and the zone at the end of the service.Cell [sic]”</p>\n\n  <p><cite><a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/fares/metropolitan-fares/\">https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/fares/metropolitan-fares/</a></cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Your first touch on creates a 2 hour fare. If you’re still travelling after 2 hours, you’ll be charged a daily fare.”</p>\n\n  <p><cite><a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki/buy-a-myki-and-top-up/myki-money/\">https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki/buy-a-myki-and-top-up/myki-money/</a></cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This doesn’t really help to answer the question. In fact, the second statement is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>To find the answer, we have to go digging around in the 128-page <a href=\"https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/legal-and-policies/victorian-fares-and-ticketing-manual/\">Victorian Fares and Ticketing Manual</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On page 44 we find:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Within the zone(s) covered by it, the 2 hour product authorises travel that extends beyond the time of its expiry, as long as the myki is touched on before that expiry, subject to the Conditions in this Chapter.”</p>\n\n  <p><cite>Victorian Fares and Ticketing Conditions 2022</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does this mean?</p>\n\n<p><strong>The 2 hour period for your myki fare begins and ends from when you touch on your card, not touching off.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For example, you touch on at 10:00am on a 903 bus at Box Hill. You alight at Northland Shopping Centre at 10:45am. You do some shopping, catch up with friends, contemplate life – whatever. You then catch a bus back to Box Hill and touch on your myki at Northland at 11:45am – so one hour and 45 minutes after you first touched on at Box Hill. So even though this bus arrives back at Box Hill at 12:30pm and you touch off outside of the 2 hour period, you will only be charged a 2 hour fare.</p>\n\n<p>Makes sense? Hopefully that helps to clear things up a little bit. If you still have any questions, let me know in the comments below and I’ll try to help as best as I can.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: there are some situations where a 2 hour fare will be valid for longer than two hours – for example, early bird on trains.

Also change &lt;fullfilepath&gt; to the path shown when you drag and drop a file into the terminal, for some reason relative paths weren’t working for me.)</li>\n  <li>Execute the command.</li>\n  <li>Once this is completed, check one of the new image files by running <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">exiftool -s</code> again on one of them to see that it has everything you need.</li>\n  <li>If you are like me, you ended up with a second copy of these files. To get rid of these, run &lt;COMMAND&gt;</li>\n  <li>Open your photos in the photo editor/organiser of your choice (I use and recommend <a href=\"https://www.digikam.org/\">Digikam</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Congratulations, that should be all!</p>\n\n<p>Once that’s done, you may want to sort them. Exiftool has a lot of different ways to do this. One of the most common is organising by date and time.

This was mainly related to people finding out about trails, routes and parks nearby for recreation as the restrictions on time, distance or both came into place.</p>\n\n<p>There was also a big element of commuting and cycling for transport. People wanted to avoid public transport due to fears of being infected. While some chose to drove, others chose to ride.</p>\n\n<p>This resulted in many people who had never ridden or not ridden for a long time being out and out.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately this resulted in some people getting lost and others using dangerous routes by mistake.</p>\n\n<p>For example, some had tried to use Google Maps to plan their journey. Unfortunately, as regular riders know, its facilities for bicycle wayfinding are substandard at best and downright dangerous at worst. For example, telling cyclists to ride along the Eastern Freeway to get from North Balwyn to Kew.
